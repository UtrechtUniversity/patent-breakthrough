when used without the hearth, the chamber under the bottom plate is closed in front, and a di rect communication is opened between the pilasters and that chamber and by extend ing the chamber to the pilasters. to make a cheap and economical grate, set permanently in the brick wall of a chim ney with my improved front, i set the rack nearly in a line with the front or jambs of the fireplace and surround the whole with an iron frame or plates of iron projecting outward from the wall of the chimney a suitable distance from the top, bottom and sides so as to present a front for the doors or inches more or less forward of the front of the rack. i then place a cross bar horizontally in front, from one side plate to the other, with a plate or valve attached, in the same manner and for the same pur poses as above described for the portable grate, and the front is closed by a closin plate below the cross bar, and above it by doors or slides paneled with mica, in the fied. same manner as in the portable grate and additional panels of mica may be inserted in the sides. see no. of the drawings: a, the rack; projecting sides and top; doors; mica panels in the side; cross bar and valve; closing plate; side section showing the cross bar and valve. the advantages resulting from my im provements, so far as respects the projection beyond the front line of the rack, are the same in both modes specified. the volume of heated air in the chamber of combustion is thereby enlarged and the gas confined; the mica in the doors is thus protected from the fire, and the valve on the cross-bar when closed upon the lower bar of the rack forces the air necessary for combustion to pass through the coal from the bottom of the rack, and prevents the air of the room, from coming in contact and deadening the fire in the rack or passing off with the fumes. the combustion is regulated by opening or clos ing the small doors or valves more or less as in stoves. the operation and the peculiar advantages resulting therefrom in the mode first de scribed, are, that after the fire is well kin dled by force of the direct draft-on closing that fluethe fumes from the chamber of combustion are forced circuitously, through the pilasters into the hollow hearth, and are carried off through the chamber under the bottom plate to the smoke pipe or chimney, radiating heat in their progress, in propor tion to the great extent of surface passed. another advantage is that when incased with tin cold air from without is made to pass between the plates till warmed or heat ed and is then discharged into the room in the manner specified. another advantage is that the closing plate below the rack, shuts from view the ashes and droppings from the rack, and by opening the door or slide in the front of this plate and the door or slide of the chamber behind the rack, the grate may be. cleared of ashes and all the dust pre vented from entering the room. my improved grate as above specified may be made wholly of cast iron, or partly of sheet and partly of cast iron, and of any size required and with more por less mica, and more doors than specified, may be used, if experience should require them, and the whole may be ornamented to suit the fancy. what i claim as my invention and im provement, and as distinguishing my im provement from all others, consists in projecting the top, sides and bottom, of the frame of the grate a suitable distance from the rack for the coal or fire, and plac ing a cross bar, in the front line of the pro jection, with a valve behind it, made to open and close at pleasure, the space projected be tween the rack and cross bar, as above speci i also claim the inclosing of the whole 100 105 10 115 120 25 30 30 10 20 25 35 40 45 60 ,001 made in the manner and for the purposes above described and specified. i also claim irrespectively a portable 20 hearth as specified, when standing in front of a fire grate and connected therewith for the purpose of conducting the products of the chamber of combustion through the same 25 in any form, so as to radiate heat there from into the apartment as new and as my invention. and to secure my invention and improve ment thus specified and claimed i solicit let ters patent. 30 front of a fire grate, with iron doors paneled with mica above the fire and with a plate of iron below the rack, in combination with the projected front, cross bar, and valve, all made substantially in the manner and for the purposes above specified. but i do not claim as my invention, the inclosing with iron and mica, or otherwise, the front of fire grates as heretofore made and used. i also claim as my invention the hollow hearth in either of the forms above specified, whether portable or fixed, when standing in front of a fire grate and connected with an entablature and pilasters or columns or with pilasters or columns alone in the manner and for the purposes above specified, and i also claim the same in combination with the projected, front, cross bar, and valve 15 may 12th 1838. witnesses: james atwater. i simeon baldwin, deninis kimberly.',\n",

       "  'contents': ',003, dated november 1838. 60 65 70 to all whom, it may concern: be it known that i, john \\'brien, of brunswick, county of cumberland, and state of maine, have invented a new and useful. improvement in windlasses for weighing anchors, raising weights, or overcoming resistances; and i hereby de clare that the following is a full and exact description. to the barrel of the windlass, such as are in common use or any to which the improve ment is applicable, is attached a ratchet wheel of cast iron which may contain twenty four or thirty-two teeth, but i do not limit myself to any particular number. the fewer the number of the teeth, the stronger they can be made; and when the wheel is com paratively small and the resistance great, it may be expedient to have but twenty four teeth or even a less number. the wheel may be on the larboard or starboard side of the windlass, or one at each side, or the wheel may be at any part of the barrel, the ful crum on which the lever block moves being properly sustained by posts or bitts. the wheel may be placed inside or outside the bitts, adjoining to or near the same, but as i prefer to have it inside, ishall describe it as so placed. when the wheel is in place on the barrel, the teeth incline from base to point toward the stern of the vessel. the diam eter of the wheel should be greater than that of the barrel, if practicable and convenient, and about three inches thick, more or less as the amount of resistance may demand. the wheel should be set on to the barrel so far as to leave, on the side next the bitts, a small space between the wheel and the bitts for the plates or checks of one side of the hooks, hereafter described; and (provided the wheel should not project sufficiently from the barrel) the barrel on the other side of the wheel should be cut away circularly ad joining the wheel, so as to make a narrow groove allowing the plates of the other side of the hooks to fall down or enter in said groove far enough for the round bolt, here after described, to catch in the teeth of the in the drawings which accompany and make part of this specification, the form of the wheel is shown at figures and hav ing an octagonal interior rim or hole to fit to the barrel of the windlass, the latter being cut into a proper shape to receive it. at fig, is shown the outline of a tooth such as i have used in a wheel of thirty inches diameter with thirty two teeth, the bottom of the excavation between the teeth, is rounded, and the bolt has a rolling rather than a rubbing friction, said circular con cave excavation being such as just to allow a free motion or revolution of the bolt and no more. the depth of excavation and the cur vature of the teeth should be such as to give strength to the teeth, and retain the bolt, but any excess beyond this is injurious. should this improvement be used in connection with the cast iron barrel of a windlass, the wheel may probably be cast at the same time with the barrel and be part of it; or the wheel may be separated and adjusted to the barrel. -two posts are to be inserted in the deck of the vessel, one abaft and the other for ward of the windlass, as shown in fig. at such distance from the bitts as to allow the i lever blocks and hooks, hereafter described, to play freely between the posts and bitts; and the posts should be at such distance from the barrels as the length of the hooks, or the position of the lever blocks may re quire. fig. indicates a part of a windlass extending from one of the bitts to the pawl bitt, and also the holes in the posts through which pass the pinsion which the lever blocks turn. the pins should enter the posts and bitts through metallic plates or boxes to prevent the wear of the bearings. the lever blocks are of iron. the form of the aft lever block is shown at a, fig. the small open circles denote holes through which passes the fulcrum pin. the blocks are placed between the posts and the bitts. if the fulcrum pin passes through the upper hole the operator exertsmore power than he would if the pin passed through the middle or lower hole. when more speed is required, the fulcrum pin is to be inserted at the mid when the number of dle or lower hole. teeth in the wheel is twenty four (which is the number intended to be indicated by the figs. and and the fulcrum pin is so placed that a quarter revolution of the handspike causes an advance of but one tooth, the power of the operator is sixfold more than that of a man at the common windlass; and where the teeth arethirty two, a similar advance of but one tooth gives an eight fold power. the proportions intend to use are in a wheel of twenty four teeth .10 90 wheel. 95 75 80 85 100 105 10 15 20 25 30. 35 40 45 50 55 70 75 80 85 90 95 ,003 10 15 20 30 any given line of fulcrum holes may, at any on a two fold, three fold and six fold power compared with the power of a common wind given position of the hook and wheel, be i rendered more oblique to the line of trac lass;

but i do not limit myself to any particular form of spring which obviously may be extensively varied. i have sometimes used a counter weight in stead of a spring, as shown in fig. but a spring is preferable, especially at sea. the fore hook as above described, is pulled when in operation, but it may be made to act as a pusher, in which case the spring may be dispensed with. fig. shows how this may be effected, and it also shows how the aft hook may be made to act as a pusher by the aid of a spring; but as these ar rangements are considered to be inferior to 10 15 20 25 30 40 45 50 55 60 35 80 90 85 75 those already described, any further de 65 scription of them is not deemed necessary or useful. should they, however, be used, the pushers or ratchets should be of such length as not to interfere, should an aft pulling hook and a fore pusher be used. 70 between the posts and the bitts may be short posts to limit the downward stroke of the handspike. it is desirableto have the short imit the stroke both at the long ort purchases, and this may be ac and complished in the following manner. when the handspike has completed its stroke at the short purchase, and is resting on the short post, if the holes for the other pur- chases be then made through the post ex actly opposite to the corresponding holes of the block as it will then be situated, one short post will answer for all the purchases. another, and perhaps a more accurate, arrangement, is to cause all the fulcrum post holes to be made when the stroke is half completed and to limit the downward strokes by movable pins inserted through the posts and bitts, the pin being adjusted as each purchase may require. the pins, as well as the short posts, limit the stroke by being placed under some part of the block and acting as a check or bar to its further motion. the posts and bitts should be wide or broad enough to allow pins to be inserted, extending from the post to the bitt (when pins are used) and if any should not be thus wide or broad, an additional vertical piece should be attached to the end of the bitt. i rely on the ordinary pawls, as commonly used on a ship\\' windlass, to prevent a recoil. a the operation of the machine is as fol lows: the handspike, inserted in the socket of the block, being elevated from a depressed position, slides over the teeth of the wheel, and being again depressed, the bolt catches in the teeth and causes a partial revolution. being again elevated it slides as before and being depressed, the wheel is again pro pelled, and so on. for the convenience of having a distinctive name, the machine is denominated the \"brunswick purchase. this machine may be used for other pur poses than forships windlasses, by connect ing the barrel by means of chains or cordage, with the object whose resistance is to be overcome, and in such cases the wheel should have a pawl or pawls, it may also serve as a press by causing a pinion on the same shaft with the wheel to mesh into a rack impelling a platen or pressing surface. i claim as my invention and desire to se cure by letters patent the following points: i claim the mode of forming or con structing the ratchet wheel to be acted upon by a round bolt or pin, confined between cheeks, or standing at right angles from a. 95 100 105 110 115 120: 125 ,003 bar, as set forth, in combination with a windlass or other analogous machine for raising weights or overcoming resistances. i claim the method, as above described of varying power and speed, as applied, to windlasses. i claim the lever blocks as above de scribed and all equivalent arrangements with mere circumstantial variations. i claim the fore and aft hooks or ratch i. ets, as pushers, as described, and combined with the other parts of the machine. i. do not claim generally the actuating of a ratchet wheel by hooks, hands, catches, ratches or ratchets other thain those above 15 described, nor do i claim except as above claimed, together with all such variations of the foregoing as are substantially the same in principle and operation. of august a. 1838. dated at washington this fourteenth day 20 john \\'brien. witnesses: geo. whiting, hugh. sweeny.',\n",

and i do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof. these improvements consist in the first place in preparing charcoal in such a man ner as to render it fit and proper for burning or being consumed in rooms, factories, churches, carriages and other places requir ing artificial heat without throwing off or giving out the deleterious vapors which arise from the combustion of charcoal not so pre pared or in the state in which it is usually sold as an article of commerce. the charcoal so prepared may be consumed in stoves or apparatus without a chimney as all the deleterious vapors (carbonic acid gas, which arise from the combustion of unpre pared charcoal are either neutralized, ab stracted or consumed in the course of such preparation and consumption and therefore the heated air and vapor arising from the combustion of the prepared charcoal may safely be allowed to escape into the atmos phere within the room or building without effecting the lungs or health of persons breathing the same. and secondary in im proved arrangements and constructions of stoves or apparatus to be used with the so prepared charcoal for the better carrying the objects and intentions of my improve ments into effect and i will proceed to de scribe the manner, method or process of so preparing the charcoal and then de scribe the improved constructions and ar rangements of stoves or apparatus to be used with the same, referring to the draw ings hereunto annexed which are representa tions of two kinds or constructions of such stoves or apparatus applicable to these pur poses. i first take the charcoal as it is usually charred or converted from different kinds of wood and sold by the charcoal burner. i break the same into lumps or pieces of 65 75 60 70 from about one to two inches cube measure. i then immerse and saturate the same (or nearly so) in a solution of alkali containing as small a proportion of carbonic acid as can procure it, say sub-carbonate of soda, which may be readily purchased in com merce, or caustic alkali and water, in the proportions of about three pounds of common soda (sub-carbonate) such as is usually sold in commerce dissolved in about twelve gal lons of water; but i do not confine myself to these quantities as the proportions may vary according to the quality and nature of the soda, or iki. after the charcoal is so saturated or partly prepared it is allowed to drain and dry in a partial degree when it lnay be used as fuel in one of the kinds or constructions of stoves or apparatus sec ondly hereinafter described or it may be taken to a purifying furnace where the char coal is further purified and its preparation completed so as to render it fit for the other kind or construction of stove or apparatus first hereinafter described, the difference in the construction of these two kinds of stoves or apparatus being, that in the one first de scribed the heated air and vapor arising from the combustion of the completely pre pared charcoal may be allowed to escape at once into the atmosphere through the body of unconsumed fuel, whereas in the second described stove or apparatus the impure vapor arising from the combustion of the partly prepared charcoal is obliged to de scend through the fire and burning fuel be fore it can escape to the atmosphere. and as i prefer completing the process of pre paring or purifying the charcoal pervious to burning it in a room, carriage or other situa tion where persons are breathing the air within, i shall proceed to describe the fur ther process of preparing or purifying the said fuel and the kind of furnace i use for effecting the same. after the charcoal has been saturated and allowed to drain as above stated it is to be taken to a purifying furnace. such as that shown at figure which is a front eleva tion of one construction which i have found to answer the purpose, fig. being a verti cal section taken through the same. a, a, is the tower or chimney of the furnace into which the partly prepared or saturated charcoal is introduced at the top part, this chimney may be constructed of iron or other 110 100 105 95 80 85 90 10 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 ,005 20 25 30 35 suitable material and is formed with the in clined plane or mouth piece bat its lower end to facilitate the removal of the fuel. is the opening or aperture by which the fuel is removed when required and is fur nished with a door pierced with holes if necessary. the tower or chimney may be set in brick work as shown in the drawing or sup ported in any convenient manner. fare apertures formed through the brick work and the tower for the admission of air to support the combustion or ignition of the fuel under process of operation. when a sufficient quantity of the partly prepared or saturated charcoal is placed in the furnace it is to be ignited at the lower part, the draft causing it to burn. the char coal is allowed to continue in a state of ig nition or combustion until it becomes thor oughly red hot and as soon as it is so it may be removed through the aperture other charcoal continually falling down as that which is red hot is withdrawn which immediately it is taken out of the furnace is put into a tank of vessel composed of iron or brickwork and closed tight by means of a lid or cover so as to exclude the air when the combustion of the prepared charcoal will be immediately stopped and extinguished in a short space to time. the now com pletely prepared charcoal may then be re moved from the tank and allowed to cool, it being in a purified state fit to be used in any open stove or apparatus or such as is hereinafter first described. the process of purifying may be continuous, fresh partly prepared or saturated charcoal being added to the furnace and removed as it becomes red hot and immediately extinguished and cooled as above stated. having now described my method or process of preparing and purifying charcoal i would remark that other alkali than that i have mentioned (sub-carbonate of soda, or rather alkali in a different state, may be used in the above preparing and purifying process and also that some of the alkaline earths may be used for the same purpose although not with such good effect. and further some or one of them may be employed in conjunction with soda or other caustic alkali. for instance, a solution of lime and water may be employed; but if lime is used it should be newly made as it absorbs carbonic acid from exposure to the atmosphere and would therefore be unfit for this purpose and it will of course be under stood by all practical chemists that soda or other alkalis possessing a too great propor tion of carbonic acid will be improper for this purpose. i therefore do not intend to confine myself to the use of sub-carbonate of soda, my invention being the preparing and 65 purifying charcoal by means of alkali in 60 40 45 55 solution and the application of heat as here inbefore described and i have only stated in the foregoing description that which have found to answer the purpose well and i will now proceed to describe the improved arrangements and constructions of stoves i have found to answer best in using the said prepared charcoal and for regulating or in creasing or diminishing the intensity of heat given out by the stove and consequently the combustion of the fuel. fig. is a side elevation of one arrange ment and construction of a small stove or apparatus for burning the said completely prepared charcoal in which the heated air or vapor arising from the combustion of the fuel is allowed to escape at once to the at mosphere and is drawn to a scale of about one third the real size and is calculated for use in a dwelling room, counting house, or office and will contain sufficient fuel for about 24 hours consumption keeping the at mosphere in the room or office in a moderate degree of temperature but the dimensions may be increased in proper proportion more in height than diameter. fig. is a ver tical section of the same. a a is the casing of the stove supported upon the bottom plate and the pillar and claw stand the top or cover di fits over the edges of the case and is to be removed by lifting it off when the fuel is to be introduced into the stove. is a hot air pipe passing through the center of the stove the lower end being open to the atmosphere, the upper end pro jecting into the top part of the cover; this pipe is kept in its proper situation by means of the guide or stretcher at the top of the cover a contrivance is placed for regu lating the draft through the stove and con sequently the heat given out and also the combustion of fuel. it consists of a sliding hollow stopper or damper shown attached at fig. fitting inside of the top part of the cover are apertures formed in the part i and by raising or lowering the damper these apertures will be opened or closed. are holes formed in the bot tom part of the stove for the admission of air to support the combustion within the open worked ornamental border being placed so as not to prevent the admission of air through them. at the same time it prevents any sparks or dust falling from the stove. the direction of the draft through the stove is shown by the arrows. are handles for the convenience of moving the stove from one place to another. in order to ignite the prepared fuel in the stove prefer when it is convenient first making a small quantity of it red hot in a shovel or ladle placed in a common kitchen or open coal fire and then placing it at the bottom of the stove and the rest of the re quired quantity of fuel above it which will 70 75 80 85 90 95 00 05 15 120 125 130 ,005 immediately ignite. but this improved fuel may be ignited in any other way as common charcoal, coke or other fuel may be ignited but when this is the case it should be done out of doors or in another room than that in which the stove is intended to be placed as there will be some disagreeable vapors gnite the arising from the materials used to i prepared charcoal although there will be none from the fuel itself. fig. is a detached sectional figure of i. another arrangement of the damper and central hot air pipe which in this instance protrudes through the damper and will be readily understood by inspecting the draw ings, the same letters of reference being marked upon corresponding parts as in the former figures. it will be seen that the greater propor tion of heat given out by this stove is by radiation no more air being allowed to pass through the stove than is required to sup port the combustion in the required degree. fig. is another sectional figure of a small stove or apparatus of the same kind or construction but without the central hot air pipe and is intended to be used in a car riage or in cabins of vessels or such other situations and may be suspended from the ceiling or roof. a. is the casing, the top on cover, a the damper, the apertures for the exit of the hot air and vapor arising from the combustion of the fuel. is the bottom plate. is another or inner bottom plate with a hollow cap formed upon it shown detached in top and side views at fig. the air to support combustion is allowed to enter the stove by the aperture formed through the bottom plates and thence through holes formed in the hollow cap to the interior. this stove or apparatus may be suspended by means of the handle i or by chains in any convenient manner. i shall now proceed to describe the second arrangement and construction of stoves or apparatus intended to be used with the partly prepared or saturated charcoal as be fore mentioned in which the vapor and heated air is caused to pass downward through the fire or burning fuel. the fuel in this arrangement or construction of stove is placed in a chamber closed at the top and is ignited at the bottom part as before. fig. is a side elevation of the stove or apparatus, fig. is a vertical section of the same and fig. 10 is a horizontal view and fig.11 a detached side representation of the outer bottom plate with the parts attached thereto showing the exit aperture for the heated air. fig. 12 is a detached side repre sentation of the cold air pipe and its cap furnished with holes for the admission of the air to the burning fuel. fig.13 is a plan view of the same. 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 of 90 70 75 80 a, a is the inner casing of the stove form ing the chamber for the fuel; bib is the outer casing. between these two cases a passage or channel is formed for the pas sage of the heated air passing from the interior of the stove to the exit aperture. is the top or cover furnished with the damper, and exit apertures is the lid lid or cover of the fuel cham ber which is to be secured tight upon its seat after the proper charge of fuel is put in by means of a screw at i or any other con the air to support the venient fastening. combustion of the fuel is admitted by the pipe which may be attached to the bottom plate supported by feet as in the former instance or it may be constructed with a sec ond bottom plate as shown in the drawing. this pipe with its cap and bottom plate is shown detached in plan and side views at figs. 12 and 13. is the cap of the pipe through which the air enters to the interior and burning fuel by means of the apertures are the apertures for the escape the heated air arising from the combustion into the passage or chamber the cup ash pit receives the ashes falling from the combustion through the holes or grating formed at in the bottom plate and is plate by a attached to the outer bottom bayonet fastening as shown in the drawing or in any convenient manner. on a charge of fuel being put into this stove the cover is first to be removed by lifting it off, then the coverg is to be taken out of the inner case and a small quantity of ignited fuel placed in the bottom part when the full charge of damp saturated or partly prepared fuel may be placed in the stove and the top or cover secured in its place. as the fuel burns the heat will cause the damp fuel to give out steam or vapor which not being able to escape at the top part of the case a to the atmosphere will be confined within the chamber until it acquires a sufficient degree of elasticity to force its way through the fire or burning fuel, and will therefore become purified, all the dele terious vapors or its impurities being there by arrested or consumed and the hot air or vapor will escape through the apertures up the chamber to the atmosphere. having now described my second im proved construction and arrangement of stove or apparatus i would remark that variations may be made in the forms and arrangements of the parts of these my im proved arrangements and constructions of stoves or apparatus without essentially de parting from the principles of their con struction, for instance, a different kind of damper may be applied thereto and also the arrangement of the apertures for the ad mission and passage of the air to support 95 100 105 115 120 25 30 ,005 30: 25 unprepared charcoal is used as in copper plate printers, bookbinders and such other open stoves and a variety of other purposes, for plate warmers, tea or coffee urns, or for boiling water in vessels, a small stove being placed or constructed in the interior of such urns or vessels; also that the same kind of contrivance may be adapted to cylinders or rollers used in paper making machinery, calico printing, drying apparatus, woolen 35 manufactures and other such purposes where red hot iron heaters or steam is now usually employed, to all of which purposes the same may be applied proper arrangements in the details of the mechanism being made ac cordingly. in witness whereof. i the said joy ce, have hereunto set my hand and seal this twelfth day of january in the year of our. lord 1838. 40 thos. joy ce. witnesses: miles berry, willm. harper. combustion may be placed differently. and further in some instances the outer casing of the second construction of stove may be dispensed with; all of which variations will readily suggest themselves to any practical engineer or mechanic. and in conclusion i would remark that if a damp or humid atmosphere should be required it is only necessary to place a small vessel containing water in the top part or cover of the stove. the water will give out steam in propor tion to the intensity of the heat and pro duce the desired effect. i claim as my invention the manner of preparing the fuel by means of alkalis, as herein set forth; and also the construction of the stoves for burn ing the same, whether of the first or second kind described, together with such varia tions thereof as are substantially the same in their operation and results. and further it will be evident that this prepared or purified fuel is equally appli cable to the purposes for which common or 15 20',\n",

       "  'contents': 'all whom, it may concern be it known that i, thomas bell, of brookhaven, in the county of suffolk and state of new york, have invented a new and improved apparatus to be used for the purpose of lifting ships and other vessels or heavy bodies from the water whenever it may be necessary to examine or repair them; and i do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof. in the accompanying drawing a, a rep resents the walls of a dock into which the vessel to be raised is conducted, the cross timbers, or beams of a cradle upon which the keel is to rest; upon which beams there are to be chocks so constructed as to support the keel and sides of the ves sel, which are to be employed with such shoring or other means of support as may be deemed necessary by the practical work men, and which do not require to be de scribed, as they need not differ from such as are well known, and in common use. the keel blocks or chocks i fix in grooves upon the cradle beams and attach tackle to them by means of suitable pulleys, in such a manner as that they may be drawn closely up against the keel and bilge of the vessel, as she is raised out of the water. on each side of the dock i build solid abutments which are to support the apparatus to be placed thereon, which i de nominate the balance power. this balance power consists principally of two triangular boxes, composed of timber strongly framed together, and closely planked on the sides, so that they may hold sand, or such other heavy article as may be placed within them. the bottom angles of these boxes are sustained upon cast iron steps, or supports, said angles being strongly shod with iron, and so formed as, with the steps, to constitute a joint upon which said boxes may tilt without the danger of their being displaced. to the upper edges of these boxes, i secure two, three, or more levers which must be of such length that by the tilting of the boxes the cradle, with the vessel thereon shall be raised to the required height. on the inner ends of these levers i place stout iron clevises, or stirrups from which descend rods a, 10 15 20 25. 30 35 40 45 50 a, a, a, which are secured at their lower ends to the longitudinal timbers i, i; from these timbers, rods descend to the cradle beams, the pieces i serving to guide them, and keep the beams at a proper dis tance apart. the triangular boxes are represented as tilted over from the dock, in the position occupied by them when the vessel is raised. this tilting is effected by one or more gov erning screws, working in a governing screw frame, attached to stout timbers which are framed together, and form the capping or upper part of the abutments this ?crew frame is shown at and separately in fig. it is attached to the timbers of the abutments by the passing of the gud geons through eye bolts on the timbers. is a stout screw which turns on gud geons in the frame at each i end; it has af fixed to it, a crown wheel into which gears alpinion which is turned by a winch, and gives motion to the screw. in the timber lu, making a part of the up per edge of the frame work of the boxes there is a strong nut, which swivels on gudgeons, and through which the screw passes. it will be seen that by this arrange ment the balance power is tilted or elevated at pleasure; in doing which, care must be taken that the respective screws are turned equally and simultaneously. were the ves sels to be raised always of the same weight the balance power might be exactly adapted thereto; but as the weight will vary greatly, i append to the apparatus above described the spars which are made strong and are firmly fixed in the boxes likemasts in a vessel; and from the upper ends of these spars suspend weighted boxes, or troughs, or blocks of metal, which as the boxes are tilted will swing out, and will greatly contribute to the effect of the balance power, and that in a degree proportioned to their weight, which may be regulated at pleasure; when swung far enough they may be secured by the ropes the spars are to be se cured by braces, and they may be operated upon by guys, should it be deemed necessary. having thus given a full description of my apparatus for the raising of vessels, and pointed out the manner of using the same, 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 92 ,009 i claim as my invention, and desire to se- therewith the weighted bodies, suspended cuire by letters patent from the upper ends of spars in the manner and operating the tilting boxes by the em- ployment of the governing screws, formed and used substantially in the way herein set forth; i and i also claim, in combination the manner of constructing, combining, i and for the purpose herein set forth. thos. bell. witnesses: linton thorn, diliberger.',\n",

strongly mounted in framing on the shaft is the fly wheele, and between that and the opposite bearing is the clutch sliding on the shaft into or out of the clutch part of the driving pinion which gears into the large tooth wheel mounted on that end of the bucket shaft i. on this the chain wheels are fitted, each wheel made with four shifting studs did to lock into the long links of the bucket chain this chain is made so that each flat link has a curve, to fit the wheels le. the large link that takes the bucket staple has a strong wrought iron brace (fig. and in given lengths, a link is

       "  'contents': \"hackling machine, patented nov. 20, 1838. no. ,012, united states patent office. foster demasters, of shelbyville, kentucky. improvement in machines for hackling lax and hemp. specification forming part of letters patent no. ,02, dated november 20, 1838. so all /von, it inctly concert shelbyville, in the county of shelby and state of kentucky, have invented a new and useful machine for hackling hemp and flax, called demasters' endless-chain hemp and flax hackle, which is described as follows, refer ence being had to the annexed drawings of the same, making part of this specification. figure is a top view; fig. side view; fig. end view; fig. end view of the many sided wheel; fig. a hackle with five rows of the same letters of reference refer to the teeth. frame on top is framed an inclired board, i, beit known that i, foster demasters, of into which are inserted a row of perpendicu lar fixed teeth, below the endless chains is placed an endless revolving apron, for carrying off the tow. on the axle of the many sided wheel is a cog-wheel or pulley, to which the propelling power is geared. under the frame are arranged a set of long stationary teeth, for taking hold of tangled hemp and preventing its passing round with the hackles. a very effectual and useful machine may be constructed of the following proportions: the chain to consist of twenty links, each sixinches from center to center, being ten feetlong, which, when doubled and put round the wheels, may be twelve inches in diameter, will make a level plane of about four and one-half feet, so that four hackles will always be in the hemp at the same time, unless the hemp should be too short. as to the width, this may be a mat it may, however, be about five ter of choice. or six feet wide, according to the quantity re quired to be dressed. the flax-hackle should be attached to a chain of six-inch links, as before, fourteen links making seven feet, also seven hackles. it will be a matter of choice as to the quality of hackles used, as hemp and flax require to be dressed finer for some uses than for others. for making cotton bagging, i set my hackle-teeth in five rows one and one fourth inch from center to center, and make the hackle any width necessary. (see fig. for finer work finer hackles may be used, or the hackle would answer were the links made shorter or longer. i would prefer the hackle teeth nine inches long, but shorter teeth or longer will do. the slips to throw off the tow may be made of wood or hoop-iron, or any thing of the kind. the wood is preferred, as it does not wear the teeth. the slips pre ferred may be one and one-halfinch wide, but wider or narrower will answer. as to the ne cessity of an apron to carry off the tow, it will be according to the use to be made of the tow. the operation of this machine is as follows: the driving power turns the pulley this the many-sided wheel and these the end less chain with the hackles and slips. the hemp to be hackled is put over the fixed per pendicular teeth in the inclined board, the loop being over the teeth, and the ends thrown over on the hackles, which, as they move on ward in the direction of the arrows, draw out same parts in the several figures. the nature of this invention consists in the combination and arrangement of certain parts of mechanism, producing a machine moved by animal, water, steam, or other power, that will perform the operation of hackling or separat ing the tow from the fine hemp or flax, and lay ing the fibers in parallel lines, more nearly in the manner accomplished by hand than by any other machine known. it consists of a frame, a, of suitable size and strength, in which turn two parallel axles, in boxes at each end thereof, passing through two wheels, and around which pass two parallel endless chains, united by parallel transverse rods screws, and nuts, to which rods are attached by links parallel slats of wood, into which are inserted long sharp steel teeth, which are called hackles. in each slat is also inserted a staple, in a line with the teeth, over which is placed a long oblong loose link or slip, which, when the slats are uppermost, rest upon them around the base of the teeth, and when the slats revolve to the under side said links or slips fall downtoward the points of the teeth, and are prevented from falling off from them by the staples and when the slats again revolve to the upper side fall back to their former position, and will be under the hemp as it is brought in contact with the points of the teeth. one of the wheels is. many-sided, with notches at the angles for taking hold of the rods of the chains in order to carry them around with the hackles, as represented at figs. and the other wheel may be made smooth. between the wheels, and in a line with their upper sides, are arranged parallel ways to support the chain from sagging. at the front end of the ,012 and separate the tow from the hemp or flax, which is carried around from the upper to the under side, when it is discharged upon the re volving apron by means of the movable slips which, by their gravity, fall from the base of the teeth to their points, and push off or separate the towtherefrom, which falls upon the floor below or upon the revolving endless apron which conveys it off at the rear end of the machine. when the ends of the hemp or flax are sufficiently cleaned, (which is easily determined by any person understand ing the business of hackling, the handfuls are taken off the permanent teeth and opened and held in such a manner as to have the middle cleaned. by having the hackles of sufficient width a person may clean the ends say from one to twenty handfuls of hemp or flax-at the same time. to clean the middles, the hands may be doubled, and two held in each hand at the same time, and all performed very easily and expeditiously. the apron is turned by means of a band, passed around a pulley, on the axle of one of its rollers, and a pulley, on the axle of the many-sided wheel. in this manner the hemp is hackled, leaving the fibers in parallel lines, much in the manner of hand-hackling. when the hemp is sufficiently hackled,itis removed, and other handfuls put in over the fixed teeth, and treated in a similar manner. in the use of endless chains with loose hackles, instead of cylinders with axles turn ing in fixed boxes, when knots happen to be in the hemp the teeth are, not liable to be broken, as the chain and lackles yield and rise from the ways, suffering he hemp to slip from the teeth, while in the of a cylinder they are liable to be broken. esides, the use of loose slips to clean the teeth by their gravity is preferable to the cam or heart wheel for that purpose. there are principles in the op eration of this hackle which were not deemed necessary to be described, viz: when the hemp is put on the fixed teeth, they being perpendicular, and eight or nine inches high, the hemp or flax naturally falls lower as it be comes better cleaned, so as not to force the hemp or flax down on the hackle so fast as to waste the lint, or do any other injury. on the same principle, when the hemp or flax is held on by hand to finish it, it is put on the top of the said teeth, and lowered as fast as necessary, so that any person understanding the art of hackling hemp or flax can see by a single glance that the lint will be saved, and at the same time straightened and cleaned in the best possible manner. there is also a principle in the operation of this hackle which seems to be essential to the good performance of any hemp or flax hackle, viz: to operate so as to save the good lint, and at the same time not to injure the hackle. this is accom plished by fixing the hackles on the chains, and operating in a straight line on the ways, with sufficient force to hackle any hemp or flax; but at the same time should any knots or tangled stuff come on the hackle, which is oc curring almost every minute, the chains will rise at the joints enough to let the knots slip of without injuring the hackle or hemp or flax, whereas solid teeth will pass through. the slips perform their part well, throwing the tow from the teeth with their own weight in a straight line, so that in making bagging for cotton and bale-rope the tow is taken from the hackle in order for use without other pre paration. other machines introduced in the southwest have been so very imperfect that manufacturers have been compelled. to aban don the use of them, and to hackle all their hemp by hand. the invention claimed and desired to be se cured by letters patent consists in the combination of the endless chains of hackles with the slips and stationary teeth in the inclined board for hackling flax and hemp, in the manner before described. foster,

new and useful improvements in pianofortes. these improvements, the principles there of, the application of said principles, by which the same may be distinguished from other inventions, the manner of using the same, together with such parts, improve ments or combinations, i claim to be my inventions, and hold to be original and new, i have hereinafter set forth and described, which description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, herein referred to, composes my specification. figures represent my improve ments, fig. is a top view, fig. is a front elevation, and fig. a view of the under side or bottom of the piano forte. the object of my invention is, to effect what is termed, the single string change of the hammers, without any lateral motion of the hammers, as has usually been the practice heretofore. it has been necessary to fit and arrange these hammers, very nicely, in order to insure their perfect ac tion when changed from the double to the single string. by my improvement one of the strings of each note, is clamped or held and thus prevented from vibrating, when the hammer strikes it. the other being free will vibrate and produce the sound. the machinery by which i effect the above opera tion, may be described as follows: a, a, a, figs. represent the frame work or body of the piano, constructed in the usual manner, or in any other way to suit the arrangement of my improvements. a, fig. are the strings or wires which are stretched over the sound ing board, in the usual manner, by being attached to metallic pins, on the side and back of the piano, the latter being those by means of which the strings are strained or tuned. figs. is a long beam, construct ed of wood or other proper material and ex tending over the strings or wires. this beam has dampers or cushions i covered with wash leather or other suitable material, attached to its underside. is another beam of similar construction to ex tending under the strings, and placed a little in the rear of the upper beam, or farther to ward the back of the piano, so that the cushions or dampers may always more ef fectually clamp the strings. this beam has also attached to it the dampers or cushions similar to those above mentioned. these beams are connected together by means of the compound levers no, op, figs. as represented therein, and are made to slide up and down in guide grooves' a' cut in the upright posts figs. constructed of wood, iron or other suitable material. the beam is cory. nected by means of the arms or uprights, fig. with a shaft, underneath the piano, the journals of which rest and move in bearings attached to the underside of the framework, as seen in fig. this shaft is operated by the lever pedal st, which has a fulcrum in the bottom of the leg or fixture projecting from the un derside of the piano. when these levers are acted upon the beams together with the cushions or dampers if, lm, are brought toward each other, and press be tween them or confine the strings thus checking their vibrations when struck by the hammers and leaving only the strings a, to produce the sounds. it will be necessary to observe also, that the hammers strike against the strings, di rectly behind the places, where they are pressed upon by the cushions or dampers of the lower beam, thus effectually preventing any vibration. a great advantage consequent on the ar rangement above described, is diminishing the liability in the instrument of getting out of tune, as by this improvement, all the strings are equally acted upon by the ham mers, whereas in other modes, particularly, when a lateral movement is given to the hammers, to change them from the double to the single string, some of the strings are struck more than the rest, so that the in strument soon becomes out of tune. this improvement has likewise another advan tage over other arrangements for the same purpose, inasmuch as it can be applied to the smaller sized pianos in which the scales are more compact than in those, in which the other modes are adopted. this arrange 20 25 30 85 40 45 50 ,014 ment also supersedes the necessity of using what are termed mutes, in tuning the instru ment. the manner in which the beams and le vers are operated may be described as fol lows: the musician bears his foot on one end ti, of the lever-pedals, fig. which presses the connecting rod at fig. against the arm of the shaft thereby raising it to gether with the arms a. to the sides of the arms a, are attached by means of pins, which allow them to move easily, the

is attached to it at the other end is brought down, at the same time, and in the same manner by the compound lever qr, as shown in fig. there is a spring attached to the underside of the frame, as

foot is removed from the pedal, and thus relieves the strings, so that the hammers shall cause all to vibrate. having thus fully described and set forth the nature of my improvements i shall claim in the same as follows. the arrangement or combination of the parts together, substantially, as de scribed. clamping the strings between cush ions or dampers, situated with regard to each other, and affixed on bars or beams in the manner herein above set forth. the arrangement of the machinery, which in connection with the beams gives motion to said beams when the pedal is pressed down by the

and i do hereby declare that the fol lowing is a full and exact description thereof. in many respects this machine resembles that for which i obtained letters patent, dated the 2nd day of march, in the year 1819, but it differs from it in the essential particular above referred to, namely, in its shearing the cloth in its passage back and forth. in connection with this have also devised a mode of reversing the motion of the brush, so as to brush the nap either way, as occasion may require, and to raise and lay the nap with the same brush i have also constructed improved regulating plates, which are attached to the cushion over which the cloth passes as it is presented to the ac tion of the shears. in this machine iemploy the flying shears for the manufacturing of which letters patent were granted to me, dated the 7th day of june, 1838, and whichare fastened by screws onto a hollow wroughtiron shaft usually of about two and a half inches in diameter. in the drawing no. which is an elevation of the front of the machine, these flyingshears, on their shaft, are shown at a, and in no. figure which is an end view, also separately, in the drawing fig. a, no. where only one blade of the shears is represented on the shaft that it may be seen more distinctly. they are also seen in section marked in drawing no. which is a vertical section of the machine from front to back, exhibiting the respective rollers, brushes, and other parts to be de scribed. the blades of the flying shears as they revolve, operate against the bed shear, which is a plate of iron,faced with steel, about the same thickness with the blades of the flying shears, andabout three inches wide. this bed shear is marked in the front elevation, no. itis ground off, along beit known that i, seth parsons, of its upper side, soas to form a suitable edge this plate, or bedshear is affixed to a cast iron barto give it sufficient support (a) no. to 60 which it is attached by screws the heads of whichare shown in it at no. the ends of this bar rest upon the frame at either end of the machine (14) nos. and which are a right and a left hand view of the ends of the machine. the bearing of this bar is usually about inches wide, having mor tises through to regulate it by means of nuts and screws up to the flying shears. the shaft of these shears run in adjustable standards made to raise, or lowerby means of nuts and screws, asmay be found necessary. the cushion over which the cloth passes, and by whichit is presented to the action of the shears against the bed shear, is con structed as follows: a cast iron bar, to give to it the requisite stiffness, reaches across the machine in the manner of that attached to the bed shear. a section of this cushion is shown at (36) no. and separately at no. is the cast iron bar, (36) is a cushion plate attached by rivets to this bar, which plate is about the same thickness and width as the bed. shear. on the front side of this cushion plate is placed a strip of iron called the regulating plate fig. no. this is about one and a fourth inch wide, and of the same length with the cushion plate; itishinged on its lower edge, so as to admit its upper edge to be brought close up under the edge of the cushion plate, or re moved to the distance of half an inch, orto any intermediate distance fromit, carrying the cloth, as it passes overit, and over the edge of the cushion plate, to, or from the bed shear. the manner in which this regu lating plate is held in its place, is shown at fig. no. a plate projects at right angles from one end of thecushion plate, to which it is attached, a spring lever is attached at one end to the regulating plate and has near its other end a pinwhich falls into holes in the plate drilled in a segment 105 of a curve of which the hinge of the regulat ing plate forms the center. there may be any convenient number of such holes, to govern the approach of the regulating plate toward the bed. shear. the object of this 10 80 85 100 90 95 25 i 50 55 92 i ,015 regulating plate is to govern the length of the nap on the different kinds of goods; and is a mode of effecting this object more per fectly than any of those heretofore em ployed, as it regulates from end to end by one and the same motion. the whole of the cushion, including the cushion plate, regu lating plate, and the castiron stiffening bar to which they are attached, is made capable of adjustment, so that it can be either raised, orlowered, or made to approach, or recede from, the flying shears, and bed. shear. for this purpose these are iron plates (37) nos. and which are about nine inches long, and an inch and a half wide, one at either end of the cushion, lying flat, against the ends of the frame, to which they are at tached at their lower ends by joint pins, or screws, upon which they vibrate. these plates have longitudinal mortises in them which receive the ends of the cushion, formed into tenons for that purpose; the mortises are made long enough to allow the tenons to have play up and down within them. a screw no. serves to raise or lower the cushion, working in female screws formed therein for that purpose. these screws may have wooden heads nos. and by which they may be readily turned. the weight of the cushion may be somanaged as to cause it to incline toward the shears, or it may be kept up by the action of the weight (11) no. at tached to a line passing over a pulley, and to the shank of the screw or to the bars (37) or in other ways. to regulate the distance at whichit shall stand from the fyingshears, screws, (41) nos. and pass through the front of the frame, their inner ends bearing against the plates (37) these screws have indexes on them (i) nos. and with index plates, no. by which to adjust them with great precision. when it is desired to shear the cloth and save the list, i effect this by a modification in the construction of the cushion. fig. no. shows the cushion thus modified, in perspective, as seen on the back side of it. a cast iron plate which for a full sized machine may be one fourth of an inch thick, and three inches wide, has a rib along the middle of it, which may be half an inch thick, and rise to the same distance, which serves not only to stiffenthe plate, but re ceives two half round pieces of iron which may be seven eighths of an inch wide, and eighteen inches long, andare firmly riv eted to said rib. this half round serves as a support, and as a center for the cushion to turn upon, to and from the shears; suit able bearings being provided to receive these half rounds, in standards rising perpendicu larly from arms running horizontally back from the front posts of the machine for that purpose; they are so fixed as to be 10 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 30 85 90 95 raised and lowered by means of screws, the screws (41) nos. and before described, serving to adjust this cushion on its face. the half rounds allow it to be shifted end wise on its bearings. a piece of nail plate which may be three inches wide, is riv eted along the cast iron plate lapping upon it about an inch; its upper edge is made straight, and in proper shape for the cloth to pass over. on this is to be fixed a regulating plate, operating and governed like that aliready described. fig. is a front view of said cushion. a piece of wood (10) is fastened by wood screws on the back of the above described plates. it is so formed as to admit the cloth to pass readily over it, and is faced by an iron plate; by which means great additional stiff ness is givento the whole cushion. in order to draw the cloth through the machine from both ends, i construct two drawing rollers; which rollers, as will pres ently appear, are alternately used as fric tion rollers also to strain the cloth and keep the lower drawing roller, which it taut. takes the cloth forward, is shown at (21) no. on one end of the shaft of this roller is a cog wheel (21) no. which is about one foot in diameter, and has 130 cogs; (17) no. is the upper drawing roller, which draws the cloth back, after it has passed the shears in the forward mo tion. the upper drawing roller is carried by a cog wheel (17) no. similar to that on the lower drawing roller. these two cog wheels are alternatelv driven by a pin ion (18) on one end of the main shaft. this pinion has its gear from one to the other, changed by means of the lever (12) carrying the arm (13) no. thus causing the reversing motion of the drawing rollers, and carrying them with equal velocity in either direction. the arm (13) forms the bearing of one end of the main shaft, which, of course vibrates with it. the fulcrum of the lever (12) is at (53) on one of the corner posts of the machine, at about one fourth of the length of the lever from its lower end. the upper end of the lever is held in place by two notches in an iron plate (11) into which it springs, keeping the pin ion in either of the cog wheels as required. i on the right handend of the machine no. is a stationary pulley (22) on the opposite end of the main shaft, fourteen inches in diameter. on the same end of this shaft is a second pulley (12) nine inches in dianeter, which is either a fast or loose pulley according as it is thrown into or out of gear with the pulley (22) it being fur nished with two engaging cogs for that purpose. the pulley (12) is that to which the driving power isapplied. the band on pulley (22) drives the shears and the brush (28) the pulley (12) is engaged 100 05 lo 120 25 30 1015 20 30 35 with, or disengaged from the larger pulley (22) by the apparatus attached to the spring lever (23) one end of which is at tached to the front post of the machine; it has on it a bow (18) which is received into a groove, on the hub of the pulley (12) the other end of the spring (23) isheld by a suitable latch, or catch, at (26) so that it may be movedin, or out of gearby means of the lever (24) no. the cloth beams are marked (20) and (25) no. these are placed above the drawing rollers, upon which they rest, andare carried around-by their friction against them. the cloth beams are kept in their places, and allowed to play up and down by the passing of their gud geons into long mortises (27) and (30) no. in the timbers which sustain them, thus adapting themselves to the quantity of cloth wound upon them. when the cloth is be ing wound off from one of these beams, it. is being wound on to the other, and itis requisite that the one from which it is to be wound shall turn freely, which it could not do if resting upon the drawing roller. it is therefore raised up, clear from said roller, and so retained as long as it is being drawn off. this may be effected in various ways, but that which i have adopted is shown at (34) and (35) no. which are studs, or catches of iron, about eight inches long, so placed that when turned up, their hooked ends, prepared for that purpose, will catch under the gudgeons, and hold the cloth rollers up. bridles (42) and (43) with weights (44) operating upon them, so as to strain the cloth, are to be put upon the ends of the drawing rollers, operating and regulated in the same way with the bridles on the cloth beam in my former patent. i employ the same kind of oiling apparatus, also, as that used by me under my former patent, ex cepting that the oiler levers (45) nos. and aremoved by a pin, or cog (47) no. 45 i in the drawing roller, instead of the cloth i beam, andare put on outside of the frame. when this machine is put into operation, the cloth starts from the upper cloth beam (25) no. and the drawing roller (17) passes thence under the cylinder (15) thence up between the brush (29) and the knuckle board which knuckle board extends along the machine turning on gudgeons on its ends, and is acted upon by the spring le ver (51) no. which spring lever is held in its place by notches in the plate (52) itis thus made to bear the cloth with any desired degree of force against the brush (29) no. thence it passes upover the cushion and regulating plate, to be sheared against the i bed shear; it then passes down over roller (16) above and back of the brush (28) and under the cylinder (19) which i call the re lief cylinder, as it turns upon a frame (48) 60 65 55 50 40 70 75 80 85 90 95 by the aid of which the cloth may be re moved toward, or from the brush (28) as may be desired. after leaving the roller (19) the cloth is conducted to the drawing roller (21) and on to the cloth beam (20) as represented and described. the lever (10) no. serves to turn the frame of the relief cylinder, and is held in place by notches on theiron plate (53) a rod of wood, to sustain the cloth when first put upon the machine, is sustained by the stand ards (49) nos. and an iron plate (50) no. is used to holdthe cushion back when necessary. the shifting brush (29) is about three inches in diameter, and has a pulley on its shaft ateach end, one of these pulleys, in driven from that of the lower brush (28) no. the other is driven by a band from the tightening pulley no. which pulley runs upona regulating plate having a slot in it, and fastened by a screw nut. the object of having a driving pulley upon each end of this brush, isto give an opportunity of reversing its motion, ac cording as one, or the other of these pulleys is in gear with its shaft. a rod, or bar ex tends from side to side of the machine, and is bent down at right angles at each end, forming the plates (32) (32) nos. and these platesare arched at their lower ends andare received into a groove on the hubs of the respective pulleys (29) (29);byshift ing this rod endwise, which may be done by a lever (33) no. or in any other con venient way, one of the pulleys is thrown out of gear with the brush shaft, and the otherin, byengaging, gearwell known to this brush is thus used either machinists. to raise orlay the napas required. the pul ley of the flying shears shaft, is also thrown out of, and into gear, by sliding.it endwise. for this purpose, lemploy the spring lever (58) no. which acts within a groove in the hub of that pulley; there be ing a notch in aniron plate (59) to hold the spring lever (58) when the pulley is thrown out of gear; the spring returning it into gear when liberated from the notch. what i claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the employment of the drawing appa ratus, as herein described, for the purpose of passing the cloth from end to end in both directions, and shearing it in its passage back and forth. i donot claim the drawing apparatus when used singly, and operating in a manner analogous to that above de scribed; but that combination and arrange ment thereof by which the double action is i claim also the mode of employing the draw cylinders, alternately, as friction, or bridle cylinders, to strain the cloth, sub stantially in the manner set forth. i also claim the particular manner of effected. 105 no 115 12o 125 130 i ,015 forming thecushions, with their regulat-with the drawing apparatus as hereinde ing plates, eitheras constructed for shear- scribed. ing the whole width of the cloth, or of sav seth parsons. ing the list, as described. i claim likewise the reversing of the motion of the brush, so as to operate upon the nap in either direction in combination .chandler ball, lyman wilder. witnesses:\",\n",

described, as far as a line drawn be tween the two apertures and of fig. 10. the rest is omitted and its place is supplied by the second part, whose outline describes a rhom bus. it is flat on the under side and convex on the upper, and has two apertures, 20 and 28, for the screw bolt to secure it to the plate, which boltis passed through one of these apertures, 20, and then through the oblong mortise of the plate, which allows the part of the share to be adjusted to the part as the latter wears, and when the part is re versed the bolt is put through aperture 28. the nut is on the under side of the plate, and is prevented from turning by the board head of the main bolt which comes against it. the front part, is fastened to the standard by means of the tenon let into the notch 21, and the bolt passes through the mold board, share, and plate, the nut being on the under side and held from turning by the head of the main bolt, as before described for the other share. no. 29 is the aperture through which the bolt passes. the construction of the wood work of this plow, being similar to other plows, need not therefore be described. the manner of putting the several parts of this plow together having been fully described in describing the parts themselves will render any further description unnecessary. the mold-board and standard being cast separate, as above described, several mold boards may be cast and fitted to the same stand ard to be used as required. no claim, how ever, is made to any novelty in the construc tion of the mold-board, although it differs in some respects from any other in use. the invention claimed by me, the said john deats, and desired to be secured by letters patent, consists in casting the standard (to which the mold board, reversible landside, share, reversible cutter, flange-plate, beam, and beam-handle are fastened) with a mortise at the point to ad mit a tenon on the share, a countersink on the mold-board side to admit the flange of the flange-plate, a mortise in the shoulder to admit the end of the cutter, as before described. casting the share with a tenon for fitting into the notch or mortise in the point of the standard, as before described. the flange-plate, in combination with the standard, as before described. the letting in of one end of the cutter into the groove of the standard, as before de scribed. the additional or double share, as herein described. john deats. witnesses: jacob lovell, huge randall.',\n",

       "  'contents': 'no. ,021, dated november 25, 1838. to all (h077) it ma/ concern: be it known that i, john meads, of the city and county of albany and state of new york, have invented an improvement in the construction of certain parts of the organ, to wit, in the construction of the wind-chest, in the application thereto and arrangement of puppet-valves, and in the mode of act ing upon the valves by means of the keys; and i do hereby declare that the follow ing is a full and exact description thereof. figure of the accompanying drawings exhibits a transverse section of some of the principal parts of the instrument, and is intended to show the connection, form, and mode of action of the valves and keys, to gether with the form and direction of the wind channels leading from the valves to the sound-board, so far as the same can be thus shown. fig. of said drawings, ex hibits the outline (in isometrical perspec tive) of part of the interior of the wind chest, with the arrangements of the valves and wind channels and their connection with the adjacent parts. for the purpose of disclosing in some measure the arrangement of the interior of the wind chest, portions of the sound board with its channels, and also of the side of the wind chest together with the tampion at the end are supposed to be removed. the thin covering (which may be either of wood or leather) of the back side of the wind chest is also supposed to be removed, in order to expose to view the diverging and converging channels in the side and to show their con nection with those in the bottom. of the valves. these are puppet valves, represented at a fig. and a, a, a, a, fig. and one of about the full size is represented at fig. they may be made of lead, tin, or other metal, or of any metallic alloy, the propor tions of which may be so varied as to in crease or diminish the weight of the valve in any degree that may be desired and there by render the touch of the keys more or less delicate, or they may be made of any other material of sufficient density and tenacity. en an instrument which has been con structed, they are composed of an alloy of one part of tin and two parts of lead. the bottoms of the valves may be either flat, convex, or of any other form which will admit of a close adaptation to their seats 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 and may be covered with soft leather or any other material which will render such adap tation most accurate. the forms of the mouths or openings which are covered by the valves as also of the valves themselves may be varied at pleasure, provided that the action of the valves as puppet valves be not thereby changed. the upper parts of the valves are intended to fit into notches cut in the edges of a thin strip of wood (marked in fig. sup ported between the two rows of valves. the portions of this strip of wood which lie be tween these notches project laterally beyond these upper parts of the valves, and thus form supporting ledges for a small rectan gular frame, which when placed upon these ledges, will by such connection complete a double row of mortises, by means of which the valves are kept in their perpendicular position when in action or otherwise. over all is placed a thin box or cap in an inverted position (a section of which is shown in fig. and marked i, the object of which is to prevent the valves from be ing thrown up beyond their proper limits. the uppermost side of this box is made of leather so as to prevent any noise being heard in case of the valves striking it. these last described fixtures however may be varied to an indefinite extent provided the same general purposes are subserved. into the bottom of the lower or bell part of the valve is screwed or otherwise fastened a steel or other wire which extends perpen dicularly downward through the bottom of the wind-chest and terminates (as shown at fig. in a small bulb or button, the lower part of which should be convex. this bulb or button comes as nearly as possible in con tact with, but so as not to rest upon, the farther extremity of a key of the ordinary piano-forte form, as shown at fig. where the keys are intended to act upon the valves of a swell in a large organ or in any case where the wind chest is required to be elevated a considerable distance above the keys, the valves and their appendages may be constructed in the same manner as those above described-and the action of the key may be transmitted to the valve by a light perpendicular rod the lower end of which may rest upon the farther extremity of the key, and the upper end of which should come as nearly as possible in contact with, but so as not to touch the bulb or but 100 05 ,021 ton at the lower end of the valve. these rods may be supported in their perpendic ular portion by being made to play through mortises in a horizontal bar supported at about the middle of the rods. the hindmost row of valves, fig. cl, and fig. a, a, a, is appropriated to the black keys, and the foremost row of valves fig. a, and fig. a. a. a. to the white keys. it may be proper here to remark, that the dotted portions of the dia gram fig. are intended to exhibit the back row of valves above referred to and also the channels appropriated to the black keys, which portions, not lying in the plane of the section represented, could not other wise have their relative position brought to view in this diagram. in order to equalize the touch of the white and of the black keys, the balance bar or fulcrum fig. of the former is placed same little distance behind that fig. of the latter, as is the case also with the cor respondent extremities of each sort of keys this arrangement being in some degree con formable to that of the piano-forte. but if the row of valves appropriated to the black keys should be changed so as to be in front of the row appropriated to the white keys it would not be necessary, in order to equalize the touch, that there should be a second bal ance bar, but both white and black keys, might then, be balanced upon the same bar. of the wind chest. the wind chest is a rectangular box of hard wood. its dimensions may be varied so as to suit the views of the builder and the size of the instrument. in an instrument already constructed of four and a half octaves and five and a half stops, the dimen sions within are as follows: length about feet, breadth inches, depth 43 inches. it is closed at the ends by tampions, which are movable at pleasure so as to permit a ready access to the valves in case of their derange ment. the wind-trunk from the bellows, may enter the wind-chest through the bot tom near either end or through the tampions by which the ends are closed. of the channels. these extend from the seats of the valves in the bottom of the wind chest and at right angles to its sides (those belonging to each row of valves being conducted to the side nearest such row) as represented at fig. except those marked fig. which are of a larger size and have their out lets at the ends instead of the sides of the wind chest, and are thence con ducted by means of tubes such as fig. and channels such as in any required direction to the large pipes to which they belong. 20 25 30 85 40 45 50 55 60 65 the channels having been conducted be neath the surface in the directions already described, until they reach that part of the bottom of the wind chest immediately below the sides, as seen in fig. and also at iv, fig. are then curved upward so as to pass into the sides as at fig. and fig. through the entire breadth of which they are conducted obliquely in the directions fig. (either onverging or diverging as the case may require, until they form a perfect junction with the parallel channels of the sound board as at fig. and fig. which lat ter channels are constructed in the ordinary way. the entire circuit of a channel is repre sented by fig. the direction of the wind being indicated by the darts. the form and direction of the channels as above described need not however be rigidly adhered to, but may be in some measure varied, provided the circuit from the valve to the sound board be completed. of the machinery pertaining to the eatra, ?lves. 70 75 85 90 the large valves fig. when placed at the upper end of the wind chest must necessarily be moved by keys near the opposite end. to effect this a short balanced lever fig. itself parallel with a pro longation of the key a, has its forward end raised by the key, and the farther end is of course thereby depressed, and thus draws down a small perpendicular bar which in its turn draws down the end of a nearly balanced lever placed behind and parallel with the wind chest. this last lever is in length about equal to the hori zontal distance of the key from the valve which it is destined to move. this last lever being thus drawn down, the other extremity is of course elevated and having also a perpendicular bar attached to it, it is thereby enabled to raise a third lever which passes transversely beneath the wind chest, and has its fulcrum at its farther extremity. upon or near the middle of this last mentioned level rests the lower ex tremity of the perpendicular wire or stem of the valve to be moved. the perpen dicular bars id, and are notched or indented at their extremities and so as to admit the ends of the levers; and in order to insure the free play of the joint, the levers are kept in place by a leather stirrup only. of the advantages resulting from the pro posed improvements. of those more immediately dependent upon the valves. to secure a perfect articu lation of the notes especially of staccato passages and of those requiring great rar 95 00 05 15 20 25 ,021 pidity of execution, it is requisite that the action of the wind upon the pipes should be, as nearly as may be, uniform during its continuance, and that its commencement and cessation should, as far as possible, be in stantaneous; and this is particularly desir able in order to secure a quick, full and dis tinct articulation in the case of reed pipes. it needs no comment to show that this end can be better attained by the use of the pup pet valve, than by that of the usual form, even if the former were opened and closed by means of the same contrivance as that ordinarily employed to move the latter. now, in the proposed improvement the action of the key upon the valve is direct and imme diate, and no sooner does this action cease than the valve is permitted to fall unchecked by any essential resistance: whereas, in in struments of the old construction, the key is made to act upon the valve through a series of intervening rods and wires, the very complication of which renders the immedi ate transmission of any impulse impossible: and hence also, the pressure upon the elastic spring which serves to close the valve will not at once cease, when that upon the key is withdrawn. in addition to all this, in the proposed construction the valve is closed by its own weight; whereas, in that now in use, the same purpose is at best effected by a wire spring, which, in order to the ready opening of the valve, must necessarily be made in ferior in the energy and rapidity of its ac tion. moreover, when the puppet valves are once closely settled into their seats or places, their own weight tends to secure and con stantly increase their tightness-the narrow margins upon which they rest, afford little room for the lodgment of any foreign sub stances-and should any such lodge there, the downward rush of the wind, when the valve is raised, would probably at once re move them, whereas the weight of the ordi nary valves has a constant tendency to open them, and any foreign substance which may acidentally lodge upon the upper surface of any of them, as upon a shelf, will be likely to remain and cause leakage. besides in the ordinary construction there is a constant leakage around each of those wires which pass through the bottom of the wind chest and move the valves; but in the construction now proposed, a similar leakage can take place around the wires of such valves only as are open, and very rarely will there be more than from six to eight of them open at any one time. of the advantages resulting from the 15 20 25 80 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 proposed wind-chest. the structure of the wind chest might seem in one respect to present a decided disadvantage, since the wind, instead of being admitted directly from the wind chest into the sound board is conducted to the latter by bending chan nels of considerable length: inasmuch how ever, as the wind chest is placed beneath the central instead of the front part of the sound board, the entire distance of the ex treme stops from the valves will be less in this, than in the ordinary construction, and the great thickness of the bottom and sides of the wind-chest admits of such a depth in the channels passing through them, that the passage of the wind through these channels will not be essentially obstructed. again, where the wind-chest has the ordinary po sition and connection with the sound board the respective distances of the several stops from the valves, are very unequal, and in consequence, it is found that what is techni cally called the weight of wind is greater upon the front stops, than upon those which are farther back; whereas, in the construc tion now proposed, the distances in question are much more nearly equal, and the weight of wind will thereby be rendered nearly equable in its distribution. upon a connected view of all that has been said, it will also appear that the pro posed improvements, while they will require the exercise of less skill in the construction of the instrument, would render it in many of its essential parts more simple, less ex pensive and less liable to derangement. the parts of the construction above de scribed of which i claim to be the inventor, ?a? the application of puppet valves in the manner and for the purposes above de scribed, or in any similar manner and for any like purposes, of, either the form above described or any other form. the position of the valves in relation to the wind-chest, and their peculiar mode of arrangement. the arrangement of the channels of the wind-chest in the manner and for the pur poses above described. the action of the key upon the stem of the valve in either and all of the modes above described or in any mode not essen tially differing therefrom. albany may 15th 1838. witnesses: john meads. wilson, orlandomeads. ___ 100 05 10',\n",

whitechapel, in the county of middlesex and kingdom of england, have invented or discovered a new and useful invention of a lamp applicable to the burning of the va pors of certain fluids in conjunction with atmospheric air or certain gases and for the application of the same; and i do here by declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof. first: as to the lamp for the better eluci dation of which diagrams in section on a half scale from the models they have been taken from are annexed to this my speci fication. figure shows a side light. this burner is divided into two parts the lower part or cup marked is made of very thin sheet, iron thinner than an ordinary visiting card indeed as thin as it can consistently be made and is about inches in length more or less and five eighths of an inch in diam eter but these proportions may be varied according to the size of the burner required. this cup may be made with or without the globular part as shown in the different figures of the drawing. the advantage of the globular part being to allow a larger space for the mixture of air and vapor or air and gas and vapor as the case may be. into this cup passes the fluid through the channel marked as high as shown by let ter which is one eighth of an inch more or less below the level of the top of the overflow pipe shown in the body of the lamp over which overflow pipe the surplus fluid (in case of any leakage or misman agement) passes into the reservoir which reservoir should be made sufficiently large to hold the contents of reservoir a. is the chamber which receives the supply of oil from the reservoir a which is made to feed the lamp upon the principle of an ordinary argand reservoir lamp. up the center of the cup and through the fluid passes the small air pipe or air and gas pipe as the case may be marked and which pipe i prefer made of thin sheet iron and carried to the height as shown in the drawing. the upper part of the burner which is made to slide on the lower part or 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 cup is made of iron or brass and through the top part of which holes are perforated as shown in the different figures in the draw ing. the holes encircling the inverted tube i and which come inside the cup are to admit the combustible mixture into the top part of the burner in the center of which an inverted tube marked the bottom of which is contracted as shown in the draw ing is made to screw. the air pipe which passes up this inverted tube allows the air or air and gas mixed as the case may be to pass into this tube which being closed at the top consequently causes such air or air and gas as the case may be to be forced downward upon the surface of the fluid and thereby forcibly to be mixed with the vapor which mixture then passes up through the inner circle of small holes into the top part where it has again to pass through other holes as shown by the ar rows in the drawing before it gets con sumed. the top part of the burner with the inverted tube i screwed through the center of its bottom is placed upon the tube which is made to slide up and down over the 'inner tube or cup so as to enable the adjustment of the distance between the top part of the burner and the fluid which va ries according to the nature of the fluid used. the gallery which supports the glass which is attached to the bottom part of the burner the holes perforated through the bottom of the top part ken circling the inverted tube and shown by the upright arrows. the holes perfo rated through the sides where the

admixture of gas with the atmospheric air as the others will admit of fig. vi shows a plan of the perforations used in this burner. fig. wil shows a side light in most re spects similar to fig. the drawing clearly showing wherein it chiefly differs-viz. by 30 another row of lights proceeding from the holes shown by the arrows drawn at right angles, and pointing upward. fig. is a plan of the perforations used in this burner. fig. ix shows a side light burner with the holes and closer to the top. fig. is a plan of the perforations used in this burner. i will here observe that when i increase the size of the lamp or 40 burner i have found it useful with some of the oils to fix fangs or prongs to the end of the inverted tube so as to dip into the fluid thereby promoting the evaporation. secondly: as to the fluids and the appli 45 cation of the gases in conjunction with the same, in this lamp i consume certain fluids obtained by the distillation and occasionally rectification from coal for vegetable tar, animal oil, turpentine resin, india-rubber, 50 bitumen, mineral naphtha, petroleum, as phaltum, and some other of the inflammable oleaginous or resinous substances by mixing with the vapor of the volatile oils obtained from these substance either atmospheric air 55 alone or a mixture of air and inflammable gas such as coal gas and others. when i use atmospheric air alone and wish to burn the coarser volatile oils i first heat the burner (which is not necessary with the 60 finer volatile oils) so as to produce sufficient vapor to become combustible and to do 35 witnesses: moffats, watson. the air also (or air and gas 85 this-namely, to heat the burner-i have re- 65 course to a little very fine volatile oil such as coal tar naphtha of the better kind which i pour into that part of the burner called the cup upon the coarse oil after which i turn on the atmospheric air and apply a 70 light to the issue of mixed air and vapor. this method of lighting the lamp need not be resorted to when a mixture of air and inflammable gas is used in such proportions as will render the mixture inflammable so 75 as to burn with flame when light is applied which will heat the burner and cause the vapor to rise after which the light becomes regular and bright with the assistance of a proper pressure on the air holder which 80 may be made in the form of a gas-holder the force or pressure on which is about an inch more or less perpendicular of mercury, varying, however, according to the bore of the pipe. mixed) may be used in a highly compressed state after the manner of portable gas. i find that about 15 percent, more or less, of coal gas is a sufficient proportion of gas to be added to the atmospheric air 90 so as to burn with flame or such proportion of any other suitable combustible gas may be used as will produce the same effect; but i do not confine myself to such proportion. i need not say that it will be prudent to 95 avoid such proportions of air and gas, as are explosive; but if such explosive mix ture be used a fine wire gauze must be placed in the supply pipe to each lamp so as to avoid the possibility of explosion. the air (or air and gas) may be supplied by a single or double acting air pump or by any other means for forcing air or air and gas. the manner in which inflammable gas and atmospheric air are mixed is too well known to require any description in this place. i therefore claim as my invention the aforesaid lamp with its several modi fication-containing the inverted tube i, and combined with the cup and their burners in the manner set forth, and combined with the apparatus described, for the supply of gas, or of atmospheric air, to be mixed with the combustible vapor in the manner de

       "  'contents': ',024, dated november 29, 1838. to all whom it may concern: be it known that i, george crane, a sub ject of the king of great britain, and inow re siding at the yiniscedwyn iron-works, near swansea, in the said kingdom, iron-master, have invented or discovered a new and useful improvement in the manufacture of iron; and the said george crane, do hereby declare the nature of my invention and the manner in which the same is to be performed are fully ascertained in and by the following statement thereof-that is to say: according to the ordinary practice of obtain ing iron from iron-stone, mine, or ore in this country the iron stone, mine, or ore (either cal cined or in the raw state, according to its re spective qualities) is put into suitable furnaces with colke produced from bituminous coal formerly called pit-coal, in contradistinction to charcoal produced from wood, which was the fuel employed in this country previous to the introduction of pit-coal in the smelting and manufacture of iron. now, as there are dis tricts in which are to be found large quanti ties of iron-stone, mine, or ore in the immedi. ate neighborhood of what is known as stone coal, or anthracite coal, it has long been con sidered as a desirable object to employ such coal for the smelting and manufacture of iron, and although attempts have been made to ap ply such description of coal in the smelting and manufacture of iron, the same have failed and have leen abandoned. in addition to such advantages to be obtained from the using of anthracite or stone coal in the districts where such coal is found, together with iron stone, mine, or ore, from the practice i have had i am induced to believe such coal, from its properties, will be found to produce a qual ity of iron more nearly resembling iron ob tained by the aid of vegetable charcoal. now, the object of my invention is the ap plication of such anthracite or stone coal com bined with a lot-air blast in the smelting or manufacture of iron from iron-stone, mine, or ore; and in order to give the best information in my power for enabling a workman to carry out the invention, i will describe the process or means pursued by me in doing so, i will suppose the furnace, of an ordinary construction, to be in blast, and that the ma. chinery and apparatus are adapted for the ap plication of hot-air blast, as is well understood and extensively applied in many places where the ordinary fuel-coke of bituminous coal or the coal in a raw state-is employed in the manufacture of iron ep iron-stone, mine, or ore, and i have found that a surface having suitable apparatus for heating the blast to about 6000 of falirenheit a good arrangement for carrying out my invention, though so high a degree of temperature is not indispensably necessary, but i believe preferable. in charg ing such a furnace i throw in about three hul dredweight of anthracite or stone coal or culm to each five hundredweight of calcined argilla ceous iron-stone with a proper quantity of flux, as if working with the coke of bituminous coal, such charging of the furnace and the general working, with the exception of the using of anthracite or stone coal, are to be pursued as if working with coke of bituminous coal; and i would remark that the quantities above given are such as i have hitherto employed in mak ing the best qualities of pig-iron-widelicet, no. or no. -at my works from the anthracite or stone coal or culm; but those quantities may be varied according to local circumstances, and the refractory nature of the iron-stone, mine, or ore, or otherwise to be reduced, and the quality of iron desired to be obtained, as is the case in ordinary working, and at the judgment and discretion of the manager as heretofore. and i would remark that the all thracite or stone coal or culm may be coked in like manner to bituminous coal before charg ing the furnace; but from my experience i have not found that such coking is necessary or that a more advantageous result is obtained than in applying the anthracite or stone coal directly from the nine; and it is desirable to observe i have found it of advantage that the blast of hot air should be as free and unim peded as possible, and from that account i have hitherto used only anthracite or stone coal, the smaller parts of which would not pass through a sieve of an inch mesh; but where the pillar or volume of blast is consider able-say two pounds and upwards on the square inch-this precaution is not necessary. having, thus described the nature of my in vention and the mainer of carrying the same ,024 culm, combined with the using of hot-air blast in the smelting and manufacture of iron from iron-stone, mine, or ore, as above described. -in witness whereof i, the said george crane, have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of march, 1837. george crane. witnesses: a. carpmael, ritchie. into effect, i would have it understood that i do not claim the using of a hot-air blast sepa rately in the smelting and manufacture of iron as of my invention when uncombined with the application of anthracite, or stone coal and culm; nor do1 claim the application of an thracite or stone coal in the manufacture or smelting of iron when uncombined with the using of hot-air blast; but what i do claim as my invention is the application of anthraciteorstone coal and',\n",

(i first called them car riages--but now slides to distinguish them from the carriage which joins and supports the sweeps mentioned herein. a socket is formed in the upper end of the lower punch ing slide, and a like socket in the lower end of the upper punching slide. these sockets receive the shanks of various sized punches or chisels, which can be taken out, put in, and changed at pleasure. the punches are made fast in the sockets by means of keys, wedges, or screws. two punches or chisels, are se cured, one in each slide, with their edges standing opposite to each other, for making the first cuts or punchings in the iron, to ward forming the ax or hatchet eye. at the joining of the shank and blade of the punches shoulders are formed, which press against the ends of the slides, during the operation of punching. i prefer punches or chisels made of cast steel, with rounded and rather blunt edges and corners, suitable for punching hot iron. the forms and sizes of the punches must, of necessity, vary to cor respond with the various forms and sizes of ax and hatchet eyes, which may be wanted. i make the punch of uniform width from the edge to the shoulder, and about one eighth part narrower than the length of the finished eye is wanted. this proportion be tween the width of the punch and the length of the eye when finished, may be varied, but the width of the punch should be something less than the required length of the finished eye. the thickness of the punch increases gradually from its edge back to the shoul der, so that after being forced into the iron and withdrawn, the opening left in the punched edges of the iron may be as wide as is wanted in the eye of the finished ax or hatchet. iron stands or projections. are cast or strongly riveted, one to the front of each side. on the upper end of the stand at tached to the lower slide, a groove is formed large enough to admit the end of the eye pin when forced through the iron in the progress of forming the eye and a guard plate of iron or other metal is cast on or at tached to the front of the same slide and rises above the end of it, to confine the iron over the groove, and prevent it from slip ping when the eye pin is forced through. the eye pins used are of common and well known forms, and of suitable length to place one end under the upper stand, when the sharpened end is placed in the punched iron, and is then to be forced through the eye by the stands, on starting the machine and putting the slides in motion. the end of the eye pin should be rounded to an edge similar to the punches, and suitable to enter and follow through the cuts previously made by punches, and the eye pin being forced through the cuts, by the motions of the slides, the eye will thereby be formed and shaped to the figure of the eye pin. i use a pair of jaws or clamps, so 10 20 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 ,02? 85 70 75 arranged as to fix and hold the iron cen trally between the edges of the punches, so that when the punches are forced into the iron they divide it in the middle, and thus leave an equal quantity of iron for the cheeks on each side of the eye. the clamps may be made to open and to close upon and hold the iron in various ways, by means of screws or by levers, which may be worked either by machinery or by the hand or foot. a good method is shown in the drawings. it con sists of levers each playing on an axis near the back of the upright frame. one end of each lever is let into the clamp bars. the other ends by means of jointed elbows are attached to crank pins or studs in opposite sides of a horizontal plate, whose center is made fast on the top of the vertical shaft. another lever is made fast, one end of it to, and near the foot of, the shaft, the other end to the horizontal treadle rod which is used to start the punching machine, with a toggle joint between the rod and the shaft. by pressing the step of the treadle with the foot, the treadle rod is brought forward, carrying along the toggle and jointed lever, and thereby turning the vertical shaft. by this motion the elbowed ends of the clamp levers are thrown farther apart, causing the opposite ends to approach, and carrying the clamps toward each other, until they close upon the iron. another method of bringing the clamps or jaws near enough together to hold the heated metal, is by a right and left handed screw, as mentioned in my caveat which i lodged in the patent office in 1837, and still another method is by a hand lever applied to the elbow levers, which any good mechanic can easily adapt and apply to close and open the clamps. the clamp bars, are solid horizon tal extensions of, and from the jaws. the clamp bars pass through mortises in their respective sides of the frame, and also through guides standing outside of the frame, to steady and guide the motions of the clamps. i use a screw gage. figs. which may be set in and out at pleasure. the pieces of iron successively introduced be tween the punches are met and stopped by the gage, the set of which regulates the length of the iron to be left solid beyond the punches, for the future poll or the bit, ac cording as the one end or the other is placed toward the gage, when introducing the piece of iron. rests of metal may be attached one to the back and the other to the front of the ways within which the slides and punches move. the use of the rests is to place the heated iron on, and support the same horizontally, ready for the clamps to take hold of, pre paratory to the punching. or the iron may be held in tongs for the clamps to seize with 65 out using rests. the rests are so plain and easy to apply that they are left of the model and drawings, to show more perfectly other parts of the machine. in working the punching slides forward and back, i employ levers or cams each turning on its respective fulcrum or axis, which passes through and is secured in the opposite sides of the frame. i attach the outward end of each slide to the driving arm of its cam or lever, by a strong inter mediate link, of iron, which plays on a movable joint at both ends, one in the slide and the other in the cam. the con necting link works at both ends, after the manner of a link in a watch chain. an other method of working the slides toward and from each other is as follows. stout cogs or teeth are cast on the back side of each of the slides, or in lieu thereof a stout rack is screwed or otherwise attached there to. the slides are made to move the requi site distance, up and down, in the ways of the frame, by means of segments of corre sponding cogs or teeth on the periphery of wheels or rollers, geared into those at the back of the slides. a sufficient alternating motion, revolving forward and back, may be given to the wheels and rollers in various ways, by means of jointed sweeps, connected 95. to a crank or wrist on the end of a fly wheel shaft, similar to those attached to the cams or levers as shown in the drawings. the cams, or segments of teeth on wheel or rollers, whichever are used, must be driven by an adequate power, with an alternating motion of such sweep or extent as will suf fice to bring the edges of the punches to gether, when worked toward each other, and when the motion is reversed, to separate the punches far enough apart to free the punched iron, and to admit between them pieces of iron of any width required to be punched. there are several different ways of giving an alternating or forward and backward motion to the cams, or toothed segments. (whichever be used) to force the slides and punches together and apart; and operate the punching machine, and also of engaging and disengaging the sweeps with the propelling power, which will suggest themselves to any competent mechanic. the method which i use and prefer is the same described in my specification of an improvement in the mode of manufacturing axes, which was patented to me march 30, 1836. for greater clearness the same is exhibited in the drawing which accompanies this description, showing the manner of connecting the punching ma chine with the fly wheel shaft, or the pro pelling power (here represented by an axle or shaft turned by a crank, also exhibiting 120 125 15 05 100 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 ,027 the extent of alternating motion, and the apparatus for starting, reversing and stop ping the motion of the slides and punches. the method and process of punching and forming eyes for axes and hatchets by the machine before described, is as follows: set the screw gage forward or backward, leav ing space enough between the back side of the punches and the end of the gage for any desired weight and depth of poll. cut from bars of iron of the requisite size, or other wise prepare, suitable pieces of iron, for whatever kind of axes or hatchets is in tended to be made. it is a good general rule to have the thickness of the piece of iron, equal to the thickest part wanted in the axe or hatchet, when finished. in general both the width and length of the piece of iron should be less than the required length and width of the finished axe or hatchet, to al low the iron to be drawn or spread to the required shape and proportions after the eye is punched and formed. place pieces of iron thus cut from the bar or otherwise prepared, in a hollow fire of suitable dimen sions to contain as many pieces as may be necessary to keep the foreman at the ma chine working to advantage. the pieces are then successively, heated to a white heat and by the person who tends the fire are con veyed, one by one, to the foreman, who takes the same in his tongs and places the piece of heated iron edgewise between the punches with one end against the gage. in this posi tion of the iron the clamps are made to press firmly against the opposite sides of the iron, thereby adjusting and holding the iron, cen trally in respect to its thickness, between the edges of the two punches. the machine is then started, which forces the punches to ward each other, until they meet, or nearly meet, in the middle of the iron. by the re verse motion of the machine the punches are then withdrawn from the iron, return to their starting points, and stop. the punched iron is then withdrawn from between the punches, and placed edgewise on the stand or projection of the lower punch ing slide, the cuts in the punched iron being set directly over the eyepin groove in the same. an eye pin of the requisite shape and size with one end properly rounded to a punching edge and corners, is introduced into the upper cut made by the punches. the other end of the eye pin is placed under the stand on the upper punching slide. the machine is then started again and by the motion of the slides and stands the eyepin is forced through the iron in the direction of the cuts left by the previous punching, the lower end or chise part of the eye pin pass ing through and below the iron into the groove formed in the lower stand. by the reverse motion of the machine the slides 20 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 again return to their starting point and stop, leaving the eye formed to the shape of the pin, and the pin remaining in the iron. the work is then taken and finished by hand haminers, triphanners, or other appropriate by a slight modification the punching ma chine is adapted and applied to cutting up bars of iron, either at right angles to their length, or obliquely, as wanted. for this purpose the chisels will be made of any de sired width and will be secured in the sock ets of the slides with their edges set in such direction as to cut across the bar of iron at. any required angle. rests or ways will be wanted and may be made in various obvious modes to support the iron and be placed at such height as will guide the bar between the chisels when standing apart. the gage which regulates the lengths of iron to be cut off may be placed either in front, or back of the machine, and the bar to be cut up will be introduced on the opposite side to the regulating end of the gage. the ma chine when thus adapted to cutting up bars of iron is connected with the fly wheel or propelling power, and is started and stopped, in the same manner as in punching ax or hatchet eyes. the peculiar character of my invention consists in using two punches or chisels at the same time to punch the same ax or hatchet eye instead of one, and in punching by the force of pressure instead of by the force of blows struck by hammers, weights, or the like (although i contemplate the ap plication of blows as practicable but less useful. the combined action of the two punches compresses the heated iron less, and divides it more exactly and equally into op posite cheeks, than is practicable with one punch, and leaves a better shaped eye to finish on the eye pin. the force of pressure as applied in the punching machine, so as always to carry the chisels to the desired point for forming the eye, and never beyond that point, whether the resistance be greater or less, consider better than blows, inasmuch as the degree of resistance varies with the variety of smaller and larger tools to be pnuched, as well as by the iron being unequally hard or unequally heated, or both. what i claim as my invention in this machine herein described, is the arrangement whereby a pair of punches or chisels are made to operate, simultaneously, on the opposite sides of the iron, so as to meet each other in the body thereof; and this claim whether the punches or chisels be driven by means of the cams, levei' and punching slides in the manner described, or in any other way pro ducing the same effect, by analogous means. 105 25 12. ,027 i claim also, in combination with the punches or chisels operated on as aforesaid, the jaws or clamps for holding the iron centrally. likewise claim in combination with such punches or chisels, the stands or pro jections at the front of the punching slides, constructed and operating substantially as described. not intending by these claims to confine myself to the precise mode of construction herein set forth, nor to the using of all the parts described, as some of them may be omitted while the main features of my in vention is retained, namely, the punching of 15 the eyes of axes, hatchets, etc. from the two sides of the iron simultaneously, thus dividing the iron more equally, and more uniformly and making better eyes, than can be formed by a single punch or chisel, or by 20 the force of blows applied to punches or chisels in the ordinary way. elisha. root. witnesses: reuben hills, henry nath.\",\n",

and i do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof. heated in capacious cylinders or tubes of east iron, the fuel for heating it being contained in ovens or arches, through which the said cylin der' or large tubes were made to pass, the fuel consumed in these ovens not being employed for any other purpose than the heating of the air. meaus, however, were soon devised for employ ing the waste heat from the tunnel-head of the furnace for heating the air to be used in the blast. this has been effected by placing the ovel on the side of the tunnel-head and open ing a flue from it into the oven. within this oven are placed a number of tubes, through which the air to be heated is forced to pass, and it has been found that the waste heat so applied has answered the intended purpose; but still it has been evident that a sufficient heating-surface has not been, upon this plan, exposed to obtain all the advantages from the waste heat which it is well calculated to sup ply, for it is a well-known fact that although the tubes have been kept red-hot the tem perature of the blast has been generally but from 5000 to 6000. the object of my first improvement is to obviate this difficulty by such an arrangement of the heating apparatus as shall expose a sufficient heating-surface to elevate the temperature of the blast to any de sired extent, the general mode of constructing the ap paratus for heating from the tunnel-head has been to place three cylinders or tubes parallel to each other and in a horizontal position within the oven, raising them one or two feet albove the bottom, so that the heat might cir culate round thei) on the upper side of the middle cylinder there. have been usually ten openings, and upon the outer ones five, fur nished with necks to receive tubes, through which the air to be heated is to circulate. these tubes are bent in form of the letter inverted, and their open ends are placed in the necks above named, five of them connect ing each of the sides with the middle tube or cylinder. in the accompanying drawings, figure is a perspective view of the furnace with the oven a upon it, and fig. is a view of the ar. rangement of the tubes constituting the heat ing apparatus as improved by me, and which instead of three, use four parallel tubes, the two on each side forming a pair, which are tonnected together by the bent tubes which rise vertically from when i say bent tubes. i refer to form only, not intend. ing to say that they are actually bent, the fact being that they are cast in that form. the vertical portions of these tubes will generally be in separate pieces, and will be connected together by the curved upper ends fitting in sockets on them. by this arrangement, with four horizontal cylinders i am enabled to put double the number of bent tubes in the space occupied by half the number with the three horizontal pipes. the air to be heated is blown. in at the end of one of the outer cylinders at it then rises in the first tier of ten (or more) vertical pipes and descends through the next tier in to the second cylinder, which com municates by curved end with the third cylinder, whence it is conveyed to the fourth in the same way as from the first to the sec ond. with the fourth cylinder the conduct ing-pipe leading to the tuyere, is connect ed. an effect nearly the same as this produced by the two middle cylinders may be obtained by using in place of cylinders curve-pipes somewhat like those used to connect the up eild of the vertical tubes, or by enlarging the middle of the horizontal cylinder, and so form ing it as to receive a double row of vertical tubes on each of the above-stated forms, inay be used with success; but i consider the first named plan the best and the most permanent. what i claim as new and useful in this part of my improvement and invention is the con struction of the pipesin the above-stated forms, so as to obtain the desired effect of increasing the fire-surface by means of two middle cyl. inders connected together, with curve-pipes at their ends, and the employment of any of the 033: above-named plans, so as to obtain a double row of vertical tubes in the middle. my second improvement consists in the nod by which i regulate the qualitity of heat admit ited into the oven by causing the conducting pipe to open or close a damper operating upon a self-regulating principle, depending tipon the variatius of temperature of the blast which the said conducting-pipe is exposed to. the damper is a flatplate of iron fitted on the top of the oven-chimney, which, by being closed, stops the rush of the flame and heat into the oven. the damper is attached to the end of the long arm of a lever, the short end of which is hooked to a rod, attached to the upper end of the conducting-pipe which has a flexible joint, by which it is united the rod at. to the connecting-tube tached to the short arm of the lever, must be made adjustable on that arm, so as completely to regulate the action of this part. what i claim as my improvement in this part of the apparatus is the employment of the hot-air-conducting pipe to open and close a damper in the chimney, in the manner se forth. mythird improvement is in the manner of witnesses: thompson, linton thorn, i. constructing a water-tuyere so as to cause it to be much less liable to get out of re pair than the water tuyeres now employed, and to render it of easy repair when it becomes necessary. the mode of making such tuyerest heretofore followed has been to cast them in one single piece, fortning a chamber near their front ends by means of a core. such tuyeres, it however, are very defective, and are incapable of being repaired. my improvement consists in casting the tuyere in two pieces, in the man iner shown in fig. where i listine front and ji the back end of the tuyere. these parts, it when put together, are secured by suitable bolts and nuts, leaving the hollow chamber and the apparattas for the passage of water as heretofore. what i claim as constituting my invention in this part of the furnace is-i the casting of the tuyere in two parts, so that the part which constitutes its point or front end may be readily renewed whenever the same may be necessary.

       "  'contents': \"15, 1838, peters. photic-liilographer. washington united states patent office. george klein, of boston, massachusetts, improved apparatus for evaporating the extract of barkand other liquids, specification forming part of letters patent no. ,035, dated december 15, 1838. to all, whom it may concerns be it known that i, george klein, of boston, county of suffolk, and state of massachusetts, have invented new and useful improvements in evaporating such liquid parts of the extract of oak-bark or other as tringent matters containing tannin as are not necessary in preparing skins or converting the same into leather, or, in other words, re ducing the extract of bark or other astringent matters to the consistence of what tanners de nominate the gum, of which the following is a specification. my improvements are also applicable to the evaporation of saccharine and saline liquids, and may be employed in the manufacture of sugar, salt, or other substances which gen erally remain after the liquids in which they are held in solution or suspension are dissi pated by heat. the disposition, arrangement, and use of the several parts of these improvements, the principles thereof, and several modes in which i have contemplated the application of that principle or character by which they may be distinguished from other inventions, together with those parts, improvements, or combinations which i claim as my inventions or discoveries, i have fully set forth and de scribed in the following specification and ac companying drawing. the old process of tanning skins by bark has been subject to great inconvenience of transportation of the material in a very bulky state-that is to say, after the bark was stripped from the tree and properly dried, it was necessary to carry it to the place of grinding, and where to be used in the prepa ration of leather. in proportion to the re motelness of these localities, so was the in convenience and expense of transportation in creased. the idea of extracting from the bark its as tringent properties and transporting the same in a reduced state has suggested many im provements in the mode of preparing or con centrating the extract of bark or changing it to the state of the gum. all these differ ent inventions or methods consistin evaporat ing a portion of the extract by boiling in va rious ways. my improvement is represented by plate i, and consists in winding around the exterior of a metallic steam-box, a, a strip of metal, a a a, and soldering the lower edge to the out side of the steam box or cylinder a, or other wise properly connecting the same thereto, while the upper edge is made to project from theside of the cylinder. by these means iform a descending groove throughout the exterior of the steam-cylinder, similar to the thread of a sclew. the box. a may be made of metal or other suitable material, shaped and formed as seen in the drawing, or otherwise properly con structed. to the top or any other conven ient part a steam-pipe, leading from a steam-boiler, is attached, and to the bottom or other proper part another pipe, is fixed, having a safety-valve, with its lever and weight fixed thereon. the object of the pipe is to convey off the water which collects by condensation of the steam. in lieu of steam, hot air may be introduced in any convenient manner should the same be preferred. af. ter the bark or other substance used is prop erly steeped in water, the infusion is poured by any convenient means into the upper part of the winding groove, which it traverses from top to bottom. passing over a great extent of surface, it is heated, boiled, and a suitable portion evaporated before it reaches the lower end, where the residuum passes in to a proper 'eceptacle in the consistence of what tanners term the gunn. a saccha rine, saline, or other liquid to be reduced may be passed into the top of the descending groove, and thus the whole, or such portion thereof as may be required, may be evapo lated in a similar manner. the whole appa ratus is to be properly surrounded by a wood en box, which prevents condensation and fa cilitates the process. during the passage of the infusion from the top of the groove to the bottom of the same it traverses a great extent of heated surface, and thus the operation of evaporating the watery parts is much more speedily conducted than in any other mode heretofore used. what i. claim as my invention is the within-described apparatus for the pur pose of evaporating infusions of bark or other infusions or liquids-that is to say, an appa ratus consisting of a hollow vertical shaft, ,035 through which steam is to be passed, and around which there is a spiral groove or chan nel, down which the fluid to be evaporated is made to descend, the whole constructed and operating substantially in the manner above set forth. in testimony that the above is a true speci fication of my said inventions have hereunto set my hand and seal this 14th day of june, in this year 1838. witnesses: geo. klein. eddy, franklin darracott.\",\n",

       "  'contents': ',086, dated december 15, 1838. to all uthom, it may concern: be it known that i, henry jones, of the city of newark, in the county of essex and state of new jersey, have invented a new and useful improvement in the con struction of trunk, chest, sliding-door, and other locks; and i do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description of the lock as improved by me. the nature of my invention consists in the peculiar construction of the two levers which pry open the jaws. the object of my improvement is to con struct a lock on a principle as much as possi ble to lessen its liability to get out of repair, with particular regard to its strength, and as much as possible to guard against the pos sibility of its being picked. to enable others, skilled in the art of making locks, to manufacture and use myin vention, i will proceed to describe its oper ation and construction. the case, which is marked a. in the draw ing is constructed of sheet iron of an oblong square. the front plate, or plate throug which the key passes, is projected or ex tended from the box or case to which it forms a part, sufficient to form a flange, by which it is screwed or nailed to the trunk or chest, upon the inner side. the working parts of the locks consist first, of the jaws, catches, or hooks marked in drawing no. their office is to hold the head of the bolt, they play each upon a pivot passing through and riv eted on the outside of the case. when shut they are parallel with each other from their pivots to about half their length, where each is curved out sufficiently to make room for the head of the bolt at the end of each jaw is a head, hook or catch to clasp the neck of the bolt the jaws or catches are kept shut by springs operating upon the out side of each. i prefer the scroll spring as in drawing no. marked on account of its diminished liability to break, although 20 25 30 35 40 45 that particular manner of spring is not es sential to the operation of the lock. in drawing no. represents the levers to force open the jaws, also represented in section at fig. they both play upon the same pivot, and are located between the straight part of the two jaws. their gen eral shape is an oblong square, their width being equal to the space between the two jaws, one corner of each lever is taken off in an angle sufficient to free and prevent its action upon one jaw; one operating upon one jaw and the other upon the other jaw. an arm is extended from each lever to re ceive the action of the key. the partition or plate separates the two arms. the ob ject and advantage of the double lever is to make it necessary, in order to open the lock, to operate upon both levers, at one and the same time. by this construction the operation of one lever alone by any instrument, not calcu lated to reach both, is not sufficient to force the bolt hence the difficulty of its being picked. a small stop port is put within the orbit of the key, which is hid by the parti tion plate its object is to stop the key and retain the jaws in an open position. the key is withdrawn by a retrograde mo tion. the bolt is riveted to a plate of a suitable shape to secure it to the lid of the trunk or chest, when the head of the bolt passes through the jaws, which are closed by the spring. what i claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the employment of two levers, which act upon the jaws or catches, in opening the lock for the purpose and in the manner herein before described. newark, november 28th, 1838. heniry jones. 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 signed in presence of eddy, david a. hayes.',\n",

(it is shown in the drawing no. with part of the end of the boiler of and the end of the strainer of also, so as to show the parti tion. this strainer prewents what remains of the cocoons that the silk is spun of from sinking and to remove the cocoons from the water when the spinning is stopped. this strainer has two movable partitions and 37 to keep the cocoons for each spindle separate from the others. the fibers of silk from the cocoons pass up between the point ed wires a and 38 (of which there are pointed and two with the ends rounded and turned out to receive the fibers of silk from the hand of the operator more readily, through the guide and 39, where it re ceives the required degree of twist, and then passes into the end of the spindle and 40 and out through the side of the spindle (41 of drawing no. of a spindle complete, showing the thread passing in through the hole and out over the hook 42 through the querlat the end of the flier arm 43 onto the bobbin) over the hookel and through the querl fonto the bobbim upon which it is wound by the spindle and flier or cylinder revolving faster or slower than the bobbin. the spindle is carried by the band and 42 from the

section showing the band whirland pulley. this large pulley is made suficiently heavy to serve for a fly wheel and pulley. it has several grooves in it of different sizes to wary the twist as it may be wanted. the band i and 44 runs in one of these grooves and then into a groove in the whirl tand 30 of the first bobbin and under the second, and so on the same man ner as the band runs that carries the spindles. there are metal cylinders or tubes upon part of the spindles as at and in the drawing open at one end and large enough for the bobbin to pass in and out freely. there is a hole 46 in the hub of the cylinder that corresponds to the one in the spindle. it is represented in the drawing no. with the side of the spindle left of, so as to show it plainlywhere the silk passes out and then along the side of the cylinder through a notch onto the bobbin. the air does not re sist this cylinder when it revolves so much as it does the flier and it is not liable to spread like the filier when it revolves fast. therefore it can be run much faster with less power. the guide band 39 and the pointed wires and 38 are all fastened to the slide 16 and 49, which may be drawn out or shoved in at pleasure. this slideis shown in draw ing no. shaded darker than, the rest of the spindle box, also a section of it to drawing no. as the spindles are all carried by one band and the bobbins are all carried by an other and the bands running under some and over others it makes part of them re volve in one direction and part in the oppo site and makes the spindles that do not re valve in a proper direction to spin revolve in a proper direction to double and twist that which hasalready been splun, the bob bins that are filled with spun silk are taken from the spindle by unscrewing the nut that holds the whirl and slipping of the whirl and bobbin of silk that is to be dou bled and twisted, which bobbins are put i upon skewers (the ends of the skewers may be seen projecting out of each end of the bobbin, 50) and set in the creel i and 51, under the spindle box. the threads pass through a guide to the top of the pulley and 52 and around the pulley and over the glass rod and 53 into the end of the spin dle. im drawing no. the end of the spindle box is left of and the spindle is shown open with the thread in it and one of the pieces that support the glass rod and the bearing of the pu?ley, so as to show the pulley and thread as it is conducted onto the bobbin. one edge of the pulley and 52 runs in the basin of water and 54 to wet 20 125 130 100 05 10 ,640 the strands of silk before they are twisted. upon the side of the pulley and 52 there is a smaller one upon which the wire hook 55 hangs that holds the weight and 56, which may be made heavy to produce any required degree of friction. upon the back end of the main shaft, opposite the crank, there is a fast and loose pulley 57 for the belt when it is operated by steam, water or any other power except the foot of the tender. the two outside spindles and the middle one may be taken out by lifting up the end where the whirl is and pulling them out. the other two may be taken out by remov ing the block and 58 and moving them 10 a little one side beforelifting them up, when they may be drawn out as the others were. what i claim as my invention and desire to secure by letters patent is 1st, the combination of the filiers and spin dles with the guides and bands of pointed wires, and 2nd the wheel (to which friction is applied) over which the silk passes in doubling and twisting in combination with 25 the macerating cup and with the flier and spindle, all as above described. 20 jonathan dennis, jr. witnesses: benjamin arnold, james arnold.\",\n",

patent no. ,043, dated december 28, 1888. to all chon, it may concern: be it known that we, joein howarth and natfian jones, of andover, essex county, massachusetts, have invented new and useful improvements of machinery for spinning cotton and twisting silk, wool, flax, and such fibrous materials to which the same are applicable, which improve ments, the principles of the same, and man ner in which we have contemplated their application, together with such parts or combinations we claim as our inventions and hold to be original and new, we have herein set forth and described in the follow ing specification and accompanying draw ings, to which we have herein referred. we shall first proceed to describe an im provement, which may be, applied to the common cotton, throstle or spinning frame. figure plate exhibits an improved flier. a, a, are cross bal' of metal, at tached to the necks or tubes the neck of the flier, has a bearing at in the rail the neck on which is a wheel or pulley turns freely on the step pin the pin operates through the bearing rails and has a screw, with a nut, on one end operating against a wound circular spring, the one end of which spring is attached to the pin and the opposite end rests against the side of the rail i, as seen in the drawings, the spindle rests in the steps at in the ends of the pin, and tube- the spool on the spindle rests on a shoulder of the spindle, and should be made to run quite easy thereon. there is a hook on one or both arms of the flier, which hook is more clearly represented in a projecting arm figs. and plate from this hook moves in a groove in the inside of a ring while the flier is revolving. the surface of the groove must be very finely polished in order that the end of the arm may traverse freely in the same. the ring is secured to a vibrating rail, while the flier revolves, the arm of of the hook is kept in the groove of the ring by the action of the centrifugal force. the yarn passing diagonally through the tube is hitched over a hook on one of the sides of the flier, and thence continues over the hook to the spool the rail being vibrated carries the ring up and down, and distributes the yarn on the spool. this flier is only intended to run in a perpendicular position, the end of the spindle being downward. in order to regulate the winding of the thread on the spool, by friction, the screw may be turned, so as to cause the step to press against the point of the spindle, and they increase the friction if necessary; so that the spindle may be retarded, to suf. ficiently enable the spool or bobbin to take up the thread as fast as the same may be splin. fig. plate is a flier of the ordinary kind now in use, with our improved spindle attached to it. a is the spindle and the flier. the flier has its two sides fas: tened at their upper ends, into a neck and their lower extremities into a cross bar on the neck a wheel or pulley a is placed on the neck for the purpose of driving the flier. the neck rests on the cross rail the step pin passes up through rails the vibrating rail the stationary rail and wheel or pulley to point of spindle a at is a long tube or ferrule resting on the vibrating rail, this ferrile incloses the step pin, and passes through the neck to the spool, the spool resting on the top of the same. as the vibrating rail rises and falls, the ferrule lifts and lowers the spool for the purpose of distributing the yarn thereon. the spool is caused to wind or take up the yarn, by the friction, which it has by resting on the top of the ferrule or by the interposition of a washer of leather or cloth between the same. the thlread passes through the neck of the flier to the spool, as in the figure. our next improvement is represented by figs. and plate and in this descrip tion: fig. is an elevation and fig. is a section. a, a, is a spindle, resting at its lower end in the end of the step pin this step pin is supported by the rails, and has a wound circular spring inclosing it with a nut and screw similar to those before described in fig. plate the upper end of the spindle rests and turns in a bearing or step is the spool placed on the spindle, and resting on the vibrating rail i, i. ix, is a tube sup ported and turning in suitable bearings in the rails the wheel or pulley 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 ioc ge ,043 is placed on the tube for the pur pose of driving the flier. a circular plate or cross bar is attached to or near the extremity of the tube and flier legs of the shape seen in the drawings, are screwed into, or otherwise properly at tached, to this plate. to one or both of these flier legs small hooks are af fixed. the spindle should be formed of an equal diameter throughout, and polished very smooth, to allow the spool to move on the same, while raised and lowered by the vibrating rail, i, i. suitable washers of leather or other proper material may be in terposed between the lower head of the spool, and the upper surface of the vibrat ing rail, in order to furnish sufficient fric tion, to retard the spool while the flier re volves, and causes it to take up the yarn as fast as spun or delivered from the drawing rollers. in order to remove the spool from the spindle, it is only necessary to pass down the step pin and take out the spindle, the front part of the vibrating rail being cut away at the bearing, for this purpose, as seen in the figure. the spool can then be taken off and another substituted whenever necessary. the thread or yarn passes from the drawing rollers into the top of the tube ik, thence through the tube, coming out at the lower ends, and passing over the guide hooks on the flier leg, to and around the spool. figs. and plate represent our next improvement. a a, are two rails, sup porting the step pin with a regulating nut and wound circular spring as be fore described in fig. the lower end of the spindle is formed conical or in any other proper manner, and rests and turns on the step in the top of the step pins. the upper ends of the spindle rests and turns in the step near the top of the tube i, as represented in section in fig. is a long tube, supported and revolving in suitable bearings in the cross rails and sustained at its top by a shoulder as seen in figs. and the lower part of the tube i, has a trumpet or other proper shaped mouth affixed to it and in this trumpet mouth there may be a flanch of suitable shape as represented by the figure, which flanch, with the surface of the trumpet mouth, serves the purpose of a pulley, for the band to run on, which drives the tube during the operation of spinning. or instead of the same, there may be a pulley affixed to any proper part of the tube. is the bobbin which rests on the vibrating rail moves freely on the spindle and has a retarding friction applied to the same, as before described in the last mentioned improvement. the thread or yarn passes into the center of the tube at its top, thence, running out through the cir cumference near the top as seen in the fig ures, it is wound once or more around the outer surface of the tube and enters the tube again at from thence it goes over a hook to the bobbin the front part of the vibrating rail, where the spindle passes through said rail, may be cut away so as to allow the spindle to be easily re moved when the stop pin is depressed, in order to take off the bobbin, when filled with yarn, and substitute another and empty one in its place. we shall now proceed to explain those of our improvements, we consider of the most importance, in spinning materials of a fibrous nature, and these are exhibited by elevations and sections in figs. and of plate a figs. and is the spindle having a metallic shoulder attached near its lower part, and also a journal which is sup ported and turns in a suitable bearing in the vibrating rail this spindle is slightly conical or tapering, as seen in the drawings, and has a small metallic roller on its up per end. is a tube of metal, the in terior of which is polished very smooth, and should be in its internal diameter of uniform size or bore in that part of it through which the roller is vibrated to and fro, during the operation of spinning, and revolutions of the tube the tube is driven or caused to revolve, by a pulley or whirl i, at tached near its top, or any other proper part thereof. it rests and turns in suitable bear ings in rails and has a circular plate or bar connected to its lower ex tremity. to the plate the flier legs are screwed or otherwise properly affixed. these flier legs should be formed tapering, that is to say, larger in diameter at or near their tops, than at their lower extremities, and should have a shoulder on each, where it rests against the lower surface of the plate for the purpose of strength ening them or preventing them from spread ing or being thrown outward by the action of the centrifugal force while revolving. small hooks are attached to each flier leg the tube is sustained during its motion in the bearing of the rails by a shoulder attached to its top. said shoulder resting on the upper face of the upper rail the spindle may be retarded, so as to cause it to take up the yarn, as the same is spun by the interposi tion of a washer or washers of cloth or other suitable substance, between the shoul der and the upper face of the vibrating rail the yarn as it comes from the drawing rollers, enters the center of the top of the tube as seen in fig. thence, it is passed out of the tube near the top through proper openings on either side as represented 10 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 69 65 70 75 80 90 95 20 125 30 ,043 in fig. at a, and after being wound once or more times around the outer surface of the tube it enters the same again at near the lower bearing. the tube is sufficiently enlarged at this part thereof (as represented in the drawings) so as to allow the thread ol' yarn a clear space to move freely between the spindle and internal surface of the tube. the yarn, after leaving the lower extremities of the tube is passed over the hooks and from these to the spindle. in this improve ment no spool or bobbin is used, the thread being wound, and the cop produced di rectly on the spindle. the cop when formed may be easily taken off from the spindle which latter is constructed tapering for this purpose, the spindle being of course removed from the tube prior to this opera tion. in order to remove the spindle, when the vibrating rail is at its lower position, it is only necessary to lift the spindle out of its bearing, in the rail, and drawing it a short distance sidewise it may be easily taken away, and replaced after slipping off the cop. should it be desirable to place a spool or bobbin on the spindle, this may be done, and the yarn wound on the same in stead of the spindles, but if it is preferred to wind on the spindle, and have the flier legs much shorter they may be reduced to about the length of the conical part of the cop, we wish to build on the spindle. this will be readily understood by the mechanics versed in spinning machinery. the next of our improvements in their order is shown in figs. and plate and is thus described. a is a long metallic tube (with a trum pet or other proper shaped mouth similar in all respects to that before men tioned and represented in figs, and plate with one exception, viz. that of being somewhat smaller in diameter. it may be driven or caused to revolve by a band passing around a pulley or whirl at tached to any proper part of it; or a flanch may be placed on the trumpet mouth, so as to form with said trumpet mouth a pulley over which the bands may be stretched. the spindle has a small friction roller a, on its upper end, and is construct ed in every other respect like that on the last mentioned improvement, or seen in figs. and the tube. a is supported and turns in suitable bearings in the cross rails the spindle rests on the vil brating rail and friction is applied to it in order to cause it to take up the yarn, by interposing a washer, or washers, of proper size and material, between the shoul der and upper face of the vibrating rail. as the yarn leaves the drawing rollers it enters the center of the top of the tube, passing out of either of the openings, i i, just under the rail it is wound one or 20 30 35 45 50 60 65 more times, around the outer surface of the tube, and is then returned to the interior of the tube through the opening and thence continues downward close to the inside sur face of the trumpet mouth, to and over either of the guide hooks to the spin dle on which it is wound by the revolutions of the tube, and movements of the vibrating rails, which supports and carries the spin dle. when the cop is formed the spin dle may be removed, and another substitu ted, in a similar manner to that heretofore mentioned in the last described improve ment. in these two last improvements, the mo tions of the vibrating rail can easily be va ried by the machinery which regulates it, operating so as to give the cop any desired shape on the spindle, which will be readily understood by mechanics who manufacture spinning or throstle frames. the bearings and shoulders of the foot of each spindle may be arranged differently, or as repre sented in fig. plate where a is the foot of the spindle, with a conical or other proper shaped end, resting and revolving in a step of the vibrating rail is the shoulder or metallic washer, as before de scribed, on the spindle. this washer is not fixed to the spindle, as in the other cases, but is loose thereon, and is prevented from slipping or revolving on the spindle, by a pin which passes through the spindle, and rests in the groove of the washer, but at the same time will revolve with the spin dle. thus, it will be seen that the foot of the spindle, is supported in the metallic step and that the shoulder rests in dependently of the spindle on the cloth washer if desirable to increase the fric tion, circular rings of metal may be dropped over the spindle, and resting on the shoulder will cause said shoulder to press with greater force or weight on the washer, and thus increase at pleasure the friction neces sary to retard the spindle, to cause it to take up the thread, as given out and spun from the drawing rollers. should the yarn break during the opera tion of spinning, the process of passing the thread from the cop, thorugh and around the spinning tube, and mending or attach ing it to the thread from the drawing rollers, is very simple and is thus effected. by ex plaining the mode of piecing the yarn of any one of my improvements it will be readily understood in all the rest, as the op erations are very similar. fig. plate represents a long wire, with a small hook -a- on one end as seen in the drawing. when the thread breaks, the hooked ends of this wire is passed down the inside of the trumpet end of the tube, (see figs. and plate through either of the openings just above the bearing rail 75 80 90 105 15 25 18o 14. ,043 the thread from the cop after being passed over one of the guide hooks on the lower circumference of the trumpet mouth, is hitched over the hook -a- of the wire, and drawing it upward through the open ing and winding the threads around the tube, one or more times, the opposite- of the wire is passed through either of the openings i, and the center of the top of the tube, and the thread on the hook is thus fastened to the thread from the drawing rollers, thus the operation is completed. to the improvements represented in figs. and of plate there should be attached a vibrating rail or rails connected to gether as seen in fig. of plate through which a step pin passes on which the spindle is to rest. the step pin and all the apparatus con nected thereto is precisely similar to those before described in figs. and of plate this is necessary to enable the op erative, to find and piece the thread, (when the same is broken on that part of the cop above the trumpet mouth of the tube, which is effected by pressing the spindle down on the step pin the elasticity of the spring restoring the steppin to its proper position after the desired operation is completed. the points of the spindles, which rest on the steppin, may have either of the shapes rep resented in fig. instead of retarding the spindle by fric tion created by means of a washer and shoulder attached to the same as before de scribed in figs and of plate we apply what we denominate a fan friction which is described as follows: to any proper part of the spindle there may be attached a rectangular or other proper shaped piece of tin, brass, copper or any other suitable metal or material (as seen at fig. which when the spindle revolves acts against the atmosphere and retards the same uni formly and sufficiently to enable it to take up the yarn or thread as fast as spun or twisted and delivered from the drawing rollers. this can be applied alike to spindle, spool or bobbin. by varying the size of this piece of metal it will be readily perceived that the retarding of the spindle, may be regulated. there may be other methods of sustaining the top of the spindle beside that repre sented in figs. and plate one of which is as follows: immediately above the holes and figs. and plate through which the thread passes to the inside of the tube, there is a collar (represented by dotted lines in figs. and plate firmly fixed to the internal surface of the tube, with a hole in the same, sufficiently large for the 20 35 40 45 50 55 60 80 spindle to pass through and turn in the same. this arrangement supersedes the necessity of a tapering shaped spindle, and likewise the roller on the top of the same, the spindle being of uniform diameter throughout its length. in order to check the revolutions of a single tube or flier (while the machinery is in motion) to facilitate the mending of the thread) there may be applied a clamp screw of any proper metal and construction, work-it ing through the top rail and against the tube as represented in the figures of plates and the operations of which will accom plish the desired effect. the arrangements of machinery above de scribed may be attached to any machine where a twisting apparatus is required, for the purpose of roving and spinning cotton or other fibrous material. the manner of at taching and driving the same will be readily understood by all mechanics acquainted with this king of machinery, and will not there fore require any description from us. having thus described and explained our improvements in the above specification and accompanying drawings; we shall claim in the same as our inventions, as follows: is .we claim supporting the top of the spindle during its vibrations or movements up and down, in an elongated tube (as rep resented in figs. and of plate whether the spindle be provided with a roller at the end, fitting into the tube, or passes through a collar firmly fixed in the inside of the tube as herein described. we claim the manner of applying the friction to retard the spindle, (in order to cause it to take up the yarn as the same is spun or delivered from the drawing rollers to be wound on the spindle) which we have herein above described and exhibited in fig. plate we claim the manner of retarding a spindle, spool or bobbin, by a rectangular piece of metal or material, attached to the same, and operating against the atmosphere when in motion, the resistance of which creates a uniformity in the retardation of the same, as herein described. in testimony that the above is a true de scription of our said inevtions and and im provements we have hereunto subscribed our signatures and affixed our seals, this twentieth day of september in the year eighteen hundred and thirty eight. assy-stag john howar.th. nathan

and ido hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description thereof. i construct a shaft, which is to be per. manently fixed in a vertical position, and of sufficient strength to sustain all the working parts of the machine. attached firmly to this shaft are two segments of cylinders, which i denominate cam wheels, as, al though they are in general stationary, they are intended to perform the office of cams, in a manner to be presently described. the upper and lower faces of these wheels, at their peripheries are so formed.as, by eleya tions and depressions upon which friction wheels are to roll, to raise and depress the pistons, or followers, by which the pressing is to be effected, and to give to the pulver ized clay, which is deposited in the molds, the pressure necessary to consolidate the earth. the stationary part of the machine, above named, is to besurrounded by a polylateral frame work which is to be made to revolve around the center shaft, and is to have on each of its sides an apparatus consisting of a brick mold, or set of molds, the pistons, or followers, by which the pressing is to be effected, together with such accessory parts as are necessary to complete the operation. the molds in which the pressing is to be effected are open both above and below, there being two followers to each mold, one of which is made to rise as the other de scends, so as to exert an equal pressure both below and above. the lower pistons con stitute the effective bottom of the mold when it is being charged with the pulverized clay, and after coperating with the upper pis tons in pressing the brick, they are made to operate as lifters, rising to the upper, sur face of the mold, and presenting the brick ready for removal, as the upper piston is withdrawn. in the accompanying drawings figure. is a perspective view of the machine. fig. is a top view, the red lines showing the periphery of the upper cam wheel, and the arms connecting it with the shaft. fig, 10 15 20 25 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 is a vertical projection of one side of the machine. fig. a sectional view in a ver tical line down the middle of fig. in the plane of the axis of the shaft. fig. is a representation of the peripheries of the cam wheels, supposing them to be cut and opened out, for the purpose of showing the eleva tions and depressions upon which the fric tion wheels are to roll, and by which the pistons are to be raised, or otherwise oper ated upon. in fig. is the lower end of the ver tical shaft, rising from the center of the base the upper end of this shaft is shown at the nut bearing on the center part of the revolving frame a, a, a, and keeping it in place; a, a, are arms con necting the frames with the hub a. when placed in a suitable building the upper end of the shaft, may be firmily attached to it. the lower part of the revolving frame is connected with the shaft by means of a similar hub and arms. in the drawing the revolving frame is represented as tri lateral, and, consequently, as carrying sets of the pressing apparatus; but the number of sides may be varied to any extent which may be found convenient. the vertical pieces are the sides or cheeks within which the sliding gates i, work up and down, for purposes to be presently ex plained. these cheeks are represented as connected together at the respective angles of the revolving frame, by means of cramps but these may be made all in one piece, or connected together in any other mode which may be preferred. the sliding gates are formed of two vertical pieces and two cross pieces, or a head and tail block and the guide piece ki, has a groove in it to receive one edge of the sliding frame, and the opposite edge is re ceived in a groove in the friction roller which revolves in a mortise in one of the cheeks which is widened out, as shown at to receive it. the front of the brick mold is seen at i, and its upper edges at i\" it is firmily fixed by its back part to the revolv ing frame; it stands centrally within the sliding frame to the lower block of which, the rods of the lower pistons, or followers, are attached. in fig. the frame is represented as having descended to its lowest point, show l00 105 ,045 suitable rollers, or in any of the known ways. in feeding it into the molds, i at present use a charger such as that shown in fig, which is made to hold the proper quantity; is filled, while resting upon the table, and then passed over the molds. i sometimes ar rest the pistons, or followers, o1, in their descent, at a point, where a proper space will be left in the molds for filling them fiush with the surface; and i subsequently allow the pistons oi, to descend to the bottom before the pistons fall upon the clay; and this i effect by covering a portion of the level part fig. with a circular strip of the necessary length and thick (ess. as it is requisite that great stability should exist in every part of the machine, i. make the whole, or the principal parts, of the frame, the molds, and whatever is suscepti ble of being so made, of cast iron. in the drawing, the revolving frame is shown as when made to operate by horse power, no. fig. being a lever, or sweep, to which the animal may be attached; the vertical pieces fig. having nuts and screws at by which to attach the arms fig. to which arms the lever is fastened. the machine may, however, be made to revolve by any of the known mean of producing such motion. i have hitherto spoken of the outer frame and its appendages, as being made to re volve; but should it be preferred to have the outer frame, and the molds stationary, this may be effected by fixing this frame firmily to a foundation in the ground, or in any suitable building, and causing the center 10 15 20 25 30 35 shaft, with the cam wheels, to revolve in a reversed direction; all the requisite move ments of the sliding frames, and pistons will then take place in the same manner, and upon the same principle, as when actuated by the revolution of the outer frame. having thus fully described the construc tion and operation of my machine for press ing bricks from dry clay, i. do hereby de clare, that i do not claim to be the first to have pressed bricks, simultaneously, on both sides, or to have manufactured them from dry clay; both of these things having been before accomplished, but by means essen tially different from that herein described. what i do claim, therefore, is the manner in which i have combined, and arranged the respective parts of my ma chine, to produce this effect, as set forth; that is to say, i claim to be the inventor of a polylateral machine furnished on each side with two vertical slides carrying pistons, or followers, for pressing both sides of the bricks simultaneously; said frames being operated upon by circular cam wheels, either by the revolution of the outer frame, or of the shaft and cam wheels the whole construct ed and operating, substantially, as herein de scribed. it is to be understood, also, that although i generally make my machines polylateral, a single press may be made on the same principle, and is therefore, included as of my invention. 40 45 50 60 65 70 stephen ustick. witnesses: jno. walker, john burns.',\n",

axle on which the fans are fixed: pulley on the axle of the fans around which passes a band leading to the engine for turning them; tube inserted into an opening in the end of the fan case for the admission of steam; opening in the other end of the fan case for the admission of at mospheric air; partition before men tioned in the center of the fan case for di viding it into an air and steam chamber; i, steam chamber;

it may, however, be introduced in other ways so as to effect the intended object. your petitioner does not claim the sole discovery or invention of condensing steam by atmospheric air or using heated air as a supporter of combustion neither the ap plication of the mercurial cage. he is aware they have been used but not to his knowledge in the manner herein described. the invention claimed and desired to be secured by letters patent is the condensing of steam by atmospheric air by means of a revolving fan, and the heated air thus produced, viz. by the proc ess of condensing used as a supporter of combustion and the application of the mer curial gage as a regulator of combustion. these severally produced by the manner be fore described or in any other way or man ner or mode substantially the same. frelight, james woodruff. asahe collins. witnesses: 75 80 85 90 95\",\n",

triangular straight or other shaped teeth-concave of reticu lated wire and brushes, door, hopper, curved grating at the bottom of the hopper, lever for raising the upper or hinged frame and hopper, axles of cylinders, and pulleys on said axles, and bands, producing a machine by which cotton in the seed is completely cleaned of trash, dead leaves, sand, and other dirt previous to its being passed to the gin, which greatly improves the cotton, and consequently increases its value, the princi pal feature of the invention consisting in so constructing the machine that the cotton after being once admitted into the machine, is carried around and around by the cylin ders of bill hook teeth and whipped, threshed, picked, rubbed, and brushed be tween the teeth and brushes and over the gratings until thoroughly cleaned, when a trap door at the end of the machine is raised plates of bill hook teeth. and the cotton, thus cleaned, is discharged, a fresh supply of seed cotton during this op eration being prevented from passing into the machine by raising the hinged frame containing the hopper which removes the grating in said hopper on which the cotton rests, out of the reach of the teeth of the first cylinder. represents the main frame constructed of a suitable shape, size, and strength, to contain and support the several parts of the machine hereafter described. one that i have used and which is represented in the drawings is rectangular and consists of four posts, four side rails, six cross grits at the ends, and four intermediate cross pieces, all well framed together. the frame, however, may be varied according to circumstances. represents a movable frame hinged to the top of the main frame at the rear end thereof by hinges on which frame the hopper is placed and secured and to which the grate in the bottom thereof is also se cured. the frame is composed of four pieces and an intermediate cross piece to which the hopper grate is screwed: it is the same size as the main frame on top and its hinges are fastened to the rear cross cap-piece of the main frame. a, three cylinders of bill hook teeth for cleaning the cotton all made alike placed parallel to each other across the frame, the teeth of one cylinder working deep in the spaces between the teeth of the next cylinder, and having their axles turn ing in boxes on the sides of the main frame and projecting sufficiently far beyond said boxes to allow of pulleys being fastened permanently on their ends by which they are to be turned by suitable bands passing around them and communicating with the driving power. see fig. representing two of the plates of bill hook teeth. the bill hook teeth will be described presently. each cylinder is composed of a number of cylindrical blocks of wood or metal of a length equal to the distance that the plates of bill hook teeth are to be placed apart say about one inch and a quarter and between which blocks said plates of teeth are to be secured, which is done by making the axles square, except where they turn in the boxes where they are made round, and then pass ing said axles through souare openings in the center of said round blocks and the

diameter and a quarter of an inch thick placed about one and a quarter inches apart according to the kinds of cotton to be cleaned-there being about six teeth in each plate and about six plates on each axle. the bill hook teeth are curved in the di rection of the movement of the cylinders, which is the same in all three, is from the rear toward the front end of the machine as indicated by the arrows. a concave grate constructed under the first cylinder a, whose bars, which are par allel, are armed with triangular or other shaped teeth and are supported on trans verse cross pieces a a of the frame, the teeth of cylinder a, as they revolve, pass between said teeth carrying the cotton with them and beating it against the teeth and bars. the triangular teeth are cast on the upper or concave surfaces of the afore said parallel bars of the concave grate. there are twelve bars in this grate cast in one, two, or more plates, or separate the spaces between them being equal. on the upper surface of the first bar, or that which is next to the left side of the frame, are cast two stout triangular teeth, near the ends of the bars. on the second bar there are no teeth. on the third bar there is one tooth of like size and shape cast near the center of the bar. the fourth bar has none. the fifth has two like the first. the sixth has none; and so on with the other six bars, every al ternate bar being without any teeth. there are ten teeth in the concave grate of twelve bars. the plates forming the ends of the sections of the bars are screwed down to the intermediate cross pieces of the frame marked a. representing a concave grate under the second or middle cylinder this grate is made and arranged in a similar manner to grate just described. represents a concave wire screen placed on and supported by transverse cross pieces of the main frame under the third or rear cylinder which screen con tinues beyond the rear end of the frame and inclines or slopes downward forming a chute as at under the center of the cyl inder in the lowest part of the concave screen is arranged a row of upright brushes and a row of inclined teeth set in the transverse piece through which the bill hook teeth with the cotton pass. the teeth incline toward the rear of the machine at an angle of about 70 degrees. at the be ginning and end of said concave there is a row of plain straight teeth placed in an inclined position, the teeth of each row pointing toward the center of the cylinder these teeth are inserted permanently into the cross pieces before described. there is another row of teeth inserted into the cross piece of the hinged frame to which the grate is fastened-said teeth pointing downward toward the center of the second or middle cylinder. represents the hinged frame support ing the hopper, the hinges of which are fastened to the rear transverse cap piece of the main frame; the hopper to receive the cotton to be cleaned. this is made simi lar to other hoppers and is fastened to the movable hinged frame curved grating at the bottom of the hopper for preventing the descent of the cotton to the cylinder auntil drawn through said grating by the bill hook teeth, which grating is cast in one, two or more plates screwed to the cross piece of the hinged frame at one side. the other side is open and detached leaving a space between it, and the side of the hopper of about of an inch to allow the cotton to descend to the grate under the first cylinder a when drawn down by the points of the teeth of said cylinder a as it revolves. the bars or fingers of the grate and the bottom of the hopper are cast something in the shape of the letter -thicker at their base, or where they unite to the plate screwed to the hinged frame than at their open or detached ends and are so placed in the bottom of the hopper that the points of the bill hook teeth, as the cylinder a re volves, do not project above the upper sur face of the grate at the thicker part but begin to project above as the cylinder re volves when near the center of the grate and gradually shows more of the teeth above the grate as they come near to the outer extrem ity of the grate, and hook the cotton thereon and draw it through said grate into the con cave grate below. by raising hinged frame in the manner hereafter described the hopper and grate with the cotton thereon is raised out of the reach of the bill hook teeth. when the frame is down the points of the teeth of the first cylinder a project about an inch above the top of the finger grates at the center and produce the effect just de scribed. a trap door hung to a cross piece of the frame at the rear end thereof to be let down for confining the cotton in the machine a longer time as to subject it to a greater action of the teeth when in a very dirty state and to be raised when the cotton is required to be discharged at the rear end of the machine over the inclined part of the wire screen marked lever for raising the hinged frame supporting the hopper and finger grate, when the trap door is closed and it is desired to admit no more cotton the fulcrum of which is seen at this to 20 25 30 35 40

piece fastened to the outer extremity of its shortest end reaching to the under side of the movable or hinged frame containing the hopper. pulleys fixed on the ends of the axles of the cylinders of bill hook teeth, as before described. these pulleys are made of round blocks of wood in the usual manner and are of such diame ter as the speed of the machine may require. on the end of the axle of the first cylinder projecting beyond the left side of the frame are fastened two pulleys-one of which is the driving pulley. on the other end of the same axle is another pulley. on the end of the axle of the second or middle cylinder at the left is fixed a pulley. on the end of the axle of the 3rd cylinder at the right side is a pulley fixed to the axle and turning with it like the rest. bands passing around the pulleys for turning them. the bands are passed around the cylinders in such a manner as to cause them all to turn in the same direction and which is too well known to every mechanic to require any further description. a band is likewise passed around the outside pulley on the end of the axle of the first cylinder. this band leads to the driving power which may be steam, water, horse or manual. boards at the sides of the frame for confining the cotton and preventing its escape at the sides. the arrows indicate the direction in which the cylinders turn. pins inserted into the left rear post of the frame under which pins the lever is placed for holding up the frame with the hopper the height at which it may be desired to hold the hopper is determined by the distance apart that said pins are placed. operation: the machine is put in motion by a drum which will give 55 to 60 revolu tions per minute to the first cylinder a and 60 to 65 revolutions to the second and third, cylinders and more or less, according to the state of the cotton. the frame being down upon the main frame the cotton in the seed is put into the hopper descends and rests upon the grate through which it is gradually hooked or drawn by the bill hook teeth of the cylinder a, which teeth carry it around and beat it against the teeth and bars of the concave grate from the teeth of cylinder a it is taken by the teeth of cylinder carried around and whipped or driven through and between the teeth of concave in like manner. from and combed, brushed, and beaten between the teeth and brushes of the concave it is then discharged through the door way at the end of the machine and delivered over the inclined wire screen into a receiver, perfectly cleaned from all trashy substances or dirt. when the cotton is very trashy and dirty and difficult to clean and after a suffi cient quantity has been admitted into the machine, the trap door is closed over the discharging opening at the end of the ma chine and the hinged frame and hopper is raised by the lever which will prevent the entrance of any more cotton; that which is thus confined in the machine will then be made to receive a repeated action through and between the several sets of teeth and brushes: for when it arrives at the rear of the third cylinder not finding a discharge it is carried around by said cylinder, when it is taken by the second cylinder and de livered back to the first cylinder which again carries it around as in the first instance to the second cylinder and from the second to the third, and in this manner the operation is repeated until thoroughly cleaned, the trash and dirt falling through the grates and screen below and the spaces at the sides. the trap door is then opened and the cleaned cotton is discharged over the in clined part of the wire screen at the rear end of the inachine. the trap door is held up by a cord fastened to a ping. it is not intended that this machine shall be limited to the precise form, arrangement, size and number of teeth or bars, or cylin ders, here described, but it is designed to vary these as circuimstances may require while the machine remains substantially the same in principle. the invention claimed and desired to be secured by letters patent consists in the before described combination of two or more transverse parallel cylinders of bill hook teeth made from separate plates of metal, each containing six teeth, more or less, working in the spaces between the teeth of the several cylinders, with longitudinal parallel concave bars armed with triangular or other teeth; placed under the first and second cylinders, between which the bill hook teeth work, and a concave of wire net work and transverse rows of inclined teeth and perpendicular brushes through which the bill hook teeth also work and a curved finger grating in the bottom of the hopper fastened to a hinged frame raised or lowered as re quired by a lever, through which finger grating the teeth of the first cylinder work, in the manner described, for separating the trashy particles from cotton in the seed preparatory to the ginning operations. jacob idler. witnesses:

convenient size crossed orlaid on each other diagonally, with proper spaces between each strip, to receive and hold the plastering laid on each side. it will be seen by reference to fig. in what manner these laths cross each other. they are to be pinned or mailed as often as may be necessary, and may be further strengthened by strips of wood or metal, a, a, a a a a' a a applied op posite to each other on each side of the lath ing and properly fastened thereto. to these latter strips may be attached the fin ishing boards and moldings, required to give the same, when finished, a proper appear ance, the latter, at the same time, aiding to strengthen the whole. the great disadvantage of other construc tions consists in their liability to twist or warp, from change of temperature, and thus derange their operation. by my application of the friction rollers, by rendering them the only points of bearing and by the above mode of con structing the partition, the difficulty, above mentioned, is successfully obviated. by placing two pinions, fig. on the shafts the movements of each end of the partition are similar and regular-and thus any tendency to bind in the groovese, is prevented. it will be readily seen that were one rack and pinion used, instead of two, that one end being raised, would cause some of the rollers to bind more than others and thereby increase the friction. this dif ficulty can not possibly take place by my arrangement of two racks and pinions. furthermore the side strips a' a figs. may be shaped wider at their tops a' a' than at their lower

and its object is to produce an instantaneous and continued evaporation of saccharine, al kaline, alcoholic, or saline liquids by means of the application of vapor or steam, as de scribed. one of the principal purposes to which it may be applied is the improvement of the manufacture of sugar. by means of this invention the period for which a liquid to be evaporated is exposed to heat is very much lessened, and the known disadvantage of the continued contact between heat and the liquid is avoided. in the manufacture of sugar by imeans of the present invention, the concentration re quires but three minutes and a half at most, and the formation of molasses is diminished. the general superiority of the machine will be seen in the promptitude and simplicity with which it works and in the economy of fuel. the invention will be understood by refer ence to the drawings annexed, taken in con nection with the following description. the evaporators may be made of copper, cast or sheet iron. a single evaporator may be employed apart; but several may be em ployed to greater advantage, and the number which may be employed together is only lim ited by the house in which they are erected and by the wants of the proprietor. the principle admits of an indefinite application, and it is this principle which forms one of the main parts of the present invention. in the plans annexed nine evaporators are repre sented, which it is intended to employ to gether, the nine constituting one machine. by means of the employment of several to gether, an economy is effected in the employ ment of heat, which will be particularly ex plained hereinafter. of the nine evaporators which constitute the machine to be described, there are four which we will call first evapo rators, and four which we will call second evaporators, with a ninth which covers all the others, and which we will calla third evapora tor. the first eight evaporators are in pairs of two each, the four pairs being placed side by side, with the large evaporator, plate fig ure 13, extending over all of them. the manner of working the machine will be ex plained hereinafter. at present the machine will be viewed in connection with the draw ings. plate fig. a is a view of the upper portion of the first evaporator or surface upon which the liquid is introduced. it is repre sented in the figure as fluted crosswise, which is the most advantageous manner, as the liq uid flows over it more slowly through flutes lengthwise, a plain or an uneven surface, will all answer the same purpose. the flutes may be made larger or smaller, and the evap orator will still perform its proper functions. if fluted lengthwise, they should not be made too high. those in the figure are intended to be one inch in breadth, and one inch dis tant the one from the other. fig. shows by means of the shadow the sides or walls of the evaporator, which are placed on the two sides lengthwise, and also at the top or up per end. the bottom or narrow end has no side. is a gutter to receive the sirup as it rolls off the evaporator, and there is no side or wall in this place; two bars of iron pierced at equal distances, which serve to unite the two bottoms a, fig. and fig. by means of screws or nuts outside of the evaporator, leaving the necessary steam-space between them; fig. under bottom of the evaporator, guttered or fluted lengthwise. the gutter, as shown in the annexed draw ings, is intended to be about an inch and a half deep. it is at the rim of the outer gut ter that the junction of the upper and low er bottom is made by means of the two bars marked and described in fig. fig. cock for the admission of vapor between the two bottoms; cock for drawing off the hot water. it is connected with a tube which communicates with the space between the two bottoms above described. fig. view of the underpart of the second evaporator, which helps to form the first pair, as above described. this is placed on the first evaporator, to receive the steam or vapor disengaged from the liq uid during evaporation upon the evaporator, which passes into it through an oblong open ing in the under bottom of the second evapo ,056 rator, above mentioned, which, as above stated, affords a passage to this vapor, so as to let it pass down the channel between the two bottoms of the second evaporator, a. a, in a groove or rabbet fitting on the evaporator be fig. i, view of the upper bottom of low it. the second evaporatorlast described, on which, as on fig. a, the liquid to be receivedis evap orated. this upper bottom is in all respects the same as the upper bottom of first evapo rator, fig. a;

distributer, as at in fig. fig. view of first evapora tor, with its second evaporator bisected cross wse. plate four figures representing four pairs of evaporators (similar to the pair already described in plate upon the same level. the steam disengaged from the liquid while the evaporator is in operation is con ducted between the double bottom of third evaporator, marked which it is employed to heat. a section lengthwise is shown atw' fig. 14. fig. 13, is an apparatus twenty one feet long and eight broad, constructed in the same manner as the second evaporator, just described in figs. and which receives between its double bottom (of which the upper bottom is only seen in the annexed drawings) all the steam or vapor disengaged from the liquid during evaporation upon the evapora tors beneath. this third evaporator, instead of being placed upon the others, as above de scribed, may be placed on a furnace, so that by heating the steam or vapor which is be tween the two bottoms, without increasing the tension, we may increase its caloric to a de gree equivalent to the greatest degree of ten sion. the apparatus can be made of cop per, sheet or cast iron. it may be fluted or gut tered lengthwise or crosswise-have a plain or an uneven surface. the two bottoms are united by means of nuts and screws at a foot or two distant from each other. the space between the two bottoms should be six or eight inches deep, to render the circulation of the vapor or steam free. it is furnished with sides, as in fig. a. any form may be given to the evaporators, and they may be made larger or smaller with out impeding their operation. the form in fig. a, is adopted, because as the liquid evaporates it diminishes in volume, and by in clining the evaporator the evaporation is has tened. the manner of working the apparatus above described is as follows: a certain quantity of liquid to be evaporated is contained in a reser voir above the evaporator, which has a cock to regulate its emission therefrom. the op eration is commenced by admitting the steam between the double bottom of the first evapora tor and opening the return-cockfor the hot wa ter. after the operation both should be shut. during the passage of the liquid over the sur face of the evaporator, forming a shallow depth from the top to the bottom, before it runs off the evaporator, it acquires the density required. it is by opening or shutting the cock of the distributer more or less, and pro ducing a greater or less emission of juice upon the evaporator, that a greater or less degree of concentration is produced. if the emission be greater, the concentration is less, and vice versa. the emission being once regulated and the cock left open and the steam kept at the same tension, the work will go on of itself; but attention must be paid to the tension of the steam, so that by means of the cock, in regulating the emission, we may diminish the quantity or increase it according as the steam may have a greater or less tension. as the evaporation of the liquid upon the evaporator is finished it flows off and fresh juice is re ceived. there is no intermission in the opera tion. the dilatation of the liquid is so great as to produce a precipitate of all foreign in soluble matter, and all matter that is volatile is carried off by the vapor or steam-an effect peculiar to this system of evaporation. the liquid which runs upon the surface of the sec ond evaporator is only heated by means of the vapor or steam produced by the evaporation of the liquid upon the first.evaporators, the de sign being to utilize the caloric of the steam produced by the first evaporation, which, in point of fact, contains nearly as much caloric as was necessary in the first place to produceit. its operation upon the range of second evap orators may be called double effect, and that upon the third evaporator triple effect. this system may be carried to any extent, and any number of evaporators may be added, es pecially if the manner which has just been specified be adopted-that of placing the third evaporator upon a furnace, by which one aug ments the heat of simple steam and increases its caloric to that of a steam of several atmos pheres, the principle being to increase the de gree of heat as high as we wish without in creasing its tension-a principle which admits of the suppression of generators of compressed steam, and by heating the vapor or steam pro duced by pressure a little above atmospheric air to produce a great evaporation with less production of steam in the apparatus. the vapor or steam produced by evaporation upon the third evaporator may be conducted by pipes to heat the stoves, the purgeries, drying-room, or any purpose. it is further apparent that in proportion to the quantity of liquid evaporated from the .56 construction of this apparatus a quantity of condensed vapor or distilled water will be col lected, which may be employed to supply the boilers with water and other purposes. there is great advantage in using distilled water in place of common water, as the boilers will not require cleansing often. an absence of heterogeneous matter in water is also ad vantageous in any process where it is required. a patent is hereby claimed for the applica tion of the above-described apparatus or evap orator, in order to produce instantaneous and continued evaporation of liquid from a less to a greater density by means of the multiplied application of steam or vapor through the use of several evaporators in one machine, as de scribed in the above specification, whether the first evaporators be heated by means of the direct action of fire, by means of heated gas, or by means of the caloric of vapor; also, for the application of the principle that steam may be heated to any greater degree without in creasing its tension, as above described. saml. harrison. witnesses: daniel brent, chas. sumner.\",\n",

forming part of letters patent no. ,957, dated december 31, 1538. to all tahon, it notif concern, be it known that i, isaac bryant, of the district of northern liberties, in the county of philadelphia and state of pennsylvania, have invented a new and useful improvement in the furnace for the manufacture of iron from the ore, called the combined hot-air blast-furnace; and i do hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description. my invention consists in the application of four new features, parts, or modes of construc tion of four several portions or parts of the furnace and its apparatus, with a view to im: prove and economise the manufacture of iron from the ore by anthracite or other coal, using the hot blast. first. iimprove the furnace by contracting its inner walls above the customary bosh or spreading, fig. and making a second bosh or enlargement or the interior of the furnace, fig. above the first or customary bosh, and above the said contraction fig. a second or third contraction and a third or fourth bosh may be added, if found expedient, the object being to diminish the pressure of coal on the lower or customary bosh, and the liability to wedging or compression of the coal at the lower part of the furnace when anthra cite is used. second. i improve the furnace by making recesses or grooves, fig. on the in ner surface of the furnace extending vertically upward from the crucible or from the tops of the tuyeres, or from the lower part of the fur nace into or near the top of the first bosh or spreading, and farther, if deemed expedient, the object being to allow the ascent of air and heat through these grooves, and thus diminish the excess of heat at and near the crucible, and diffuse the heat and combustion more equally throughout the mass. the number of these grooves or recesses may vary as expediency may dictate. third. iimprove the convenience and econ omy of the method of heating the air for a hot blast by contracting the upper part of the fur nace to a large flue, fig. and constructing a chamber, surrounding it between an outer and an inner cylinder, the outer cylin der consisting of the exterior wall of the fur nace, and the inner cylinder consisting of the exterior wall of the said fluef. in this cham ber iheat the air for blast by passing through the chamber the blast-pipe in numerous un dulations, convolutions, or windings, so as to expose a great surface to the heat of the cham her which escapes from the upper part of the furnace, and is conducted into the lower part of the chamber by several smaller flues or pipes passing from the furnace near the foot of the fue underneath the brick-work fourth. i improve the water-tuyeres or parts through which the blast enters the crucible of the furnace by making a narrow and oblong opening from each tuyere (see fig. for the passage of the blast, instead of a round open ing, as usually practiced, thereby diffusing the application of the blast more extensively around the furnace and upon the fuel. fifth. i cool the crucible of the furnace and prevent its burning rapidly away by placing around it several metallic boxes or cases filled with water, the water entering at an aper ture in the lower portion of each box and pass ing out at the upper portion, so as to keep up a constant current, and thus absorb a portion of the heat from the crucible. these improvements are described in con nection with the whole furnace and with ref. erence to the annexed drawings, as follows: figure i exhibits a front view of the en tire furnace. fig. the smaller

have invented new and useful improvements of machinery to be ap plied to engines used in the manufacture of paper for the purpose of converting rags into pulp. the said improvements, the principles thereof and manner in which i have con templated their application, together with such parts or combinations i claim to be my inventions and hold to be original and new, i have herein set forth and described, which description, in connection with the accompa nying drawings, herein referred to, com poses my specification. in ordinary engines the gudgeons of the shaft of the beating cylinder rest in bear ings attached to the upper faces of two beams or lighters, the end of one of which is capable of being raised or depressed by a screw operating thereon. the object of the above is to regulate the distance, from time to time between the cutting edges of the knives of the beater and those of the knives of the block. as these regulating screws have heretofore been turned by the hand of the workman or attendant of the engine, the same depending on his judgment and skill, it will be evident that any neglect of duty or want of necessary judgment on his part has been of material disadvantage, not only to the operation of converting rags to the consistance of pulp, but to the in terests of the paper maker. in order to insure regularity in the ac tion of the beating cylinder and to change the distance between its teeth and those of the block in such quantity and at such proper intervais of time as may be neces sary i have invented the following machin ery: plates and figures represent front and side views of my improvements. a, a, denotes one of the lighter' posts of the engine, placed and situated in the usual manner or in any other convenient position. is the beam or lighter, on which one of the journals of the shaft of the roll or cylinder rests and is supported in a proper box or bearing. on the end of the shaft fig. of the roll or cylinder a pulley of any convenient size is affixed from this pully a band a, a, passes to and alround another pully on a small hori zontal shaft supported by a frame-work or standard on one extremity of the shaft a small beveled pinion is placed, which operates and turns a beveled wheel on the end of a long horizontal shaft the shaft rests in suitable boxes or bearings i, the former of which bear ings is attached to the standard and the latter to the post a. on the other ex tremity of the shaft a small endless screw figs. is fixed, which operates and turns around a gear wheel plates and the gear wheel is attached to the end of a shaft plate which rests and turns in suitable boxes or bearings con nected to the lower part of a metallic frame held up to the side of the post a, by screws or bolts ke, passing through the elongated slots i. i. i. i. toward the middle of the shaft gy, an endless screw (represented in plate by dotted lines) is fixed on said shaft, which plays with the teeth of a gear wheel plates and the gear wheel is placed near the extremity of a shaft which revolves in suitable boxes or bearings, attached to the lower side of the rectangular opening of the post a. a cam of any suit able shape may be placed on one end of the shaft a pitman rests at its foot on the curved surface of this cam, and is at tached at its upper extremity by nuts in, and screw to a piece of metal con nected to the end of the beam or lighter the opposite end of the lighter turns on a bolt pin or hinge in the usual manner. as the gear wheel is revolved in the di rection of the arrows, (plate by the other machinery the lower end of the pit man passes over the curved surface of the cam and descends to the cam being of such shape as to give the pitman, and of course the lighter such a movement downward as may be desirable. when the foot of the pitman arrives at the end of the cam comes in contact with the end of a lever or latch causing, the upper part of at of said lever to be borne away from a pin ae, of the frame a spring presses the end of the latch against the pin a. the pitman is guided during its motion by passing through a slot ae, formed in the cross bar plate 75 80 85 90 95 00 105 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 ,059 it was before mentioned that the frame was attached to the post a, by bolts le, passing through elongated slots i, i. a, is a lever turning on a fulcrum in the upper part of the side of the rectan gular opening plates and the end a' of the short arm of this lever presses against the underside of the upper cross bar of the frame on the other end a weighte' is suspended by a rod as the end of the latch is pressed away from the pin a, the weighte' acting on the lever a raises the frame sufficiently to lift the endless screw and cogwheel out of gear with the wheel and screw and thus stops the operation of the shaft on the lighter' and the rest of the machinery. i have devised several other modes of regulating the downward motion of the beating cylinder, which possess the advan tages of and in some respects may be pre ferred to that above described. instead of the wheel and cam i can cut a screw a' fig. of any requisite thread on the shaft gy, between the bxoes plate which screw should operate in a female screw attached to the lower side of a wedge or inclined plane whose upper surface may be straight or curved. on the upper surface of this elongated cam or wedge the foot of the pitman may rest so that when the wedge is drawn toward the gear the pitman may descend with such a downward motion as may be required. in this plan the shaft figs. and turns and rests near the pinion in a box on the end of a lever whose fulcrum is at he is a latch or catch the foot of which hooks around a pin projecting from the lever an is a spring to press said latch against the pin the latch or catch moves on a pin when the projection of the female screw comes in contact with the upper 20 30 35 50 55 60 65 ae, part of the latch (or in other words when the pitman has moved over the en tire surface of the inclined plane to it presses the latch away from the pin which suffers the endless screw and the shaft to drop downward, so as to throw the

female screw in any convenient have also contemplated attaching a gear wheel to the top of the screw usually em ployed to raise the lighter and by suitable intervening machinery between the same and the cylinder shaft cause the said screw to turn around and lower the end of the lighter such a quantity, from time to time, as may be desirable. but as such a mode of ac complishing the object of my improvements is attended with much complication of ma chinery and consequent expense and liability of becoming deranged or out of repair, i. have preferred those which i have herein particularly set forth and described. in the above claim as follows: regulating the downward motion of the lighter by means of the cam (of the shape represented in plate or otherwise properly formed) and also by means of the inclined plane fig. acting on the lighter, or on the extremity of a pitman connected to the lighter, or a projection from the same as herein above set forth. in testimony that the above is a
