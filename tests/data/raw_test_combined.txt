A. IMPROVERENT INSEED-PALNTERS AND FERTILIZER-DISTRIBUTERS, Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 100,00A, dated February 22, 1st (). To all ution, it nually concern. Be it known that I, JoSEPHARRINGTON, of Livingston, in the county of Sumter and State of Alabama, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Seed-Planters and Fertilizer Distributers; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact descrip tion thereof, which will enable others skilled in the art to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, forming part of this specification, in which Figure 1 is a side view of my inproved ma chine, parts being broken away to show the construction. Fig. 2 is a top view of the same, parts being broken away to show the con struction. Fig. 3 is a detail top view of the dropping device, showing it adjusted for dis tributing a fertilizer. Fig. 4 is a detail sec tional view of the same, taken through the line & 2, Fig. 3. Similar letters of reference indicate corre Sponding parts. My invention has for its object to furnish a simple, convenient, and effective machine which shall be so constructed and arranged that it may be easily and conveniently adjust ed for planting cotton-seed or other seed or for distributing guano or other fine fertilizer, doing its work well and thoroughly in either capacity; and it consists in the construction and combination of various parts of the ma chine, as hereinafter more fully described. A is the plow-beam, B are the handles, and C is the plow-standard, to the lower end of which the opening or furrowing plow D is attached, about the construction of which parts there is nothing new. To the plow-beam Aare attached the lower ends of the standards or supports E, with the upper ends of which are connected the for ward ends of the bar F. The real ends of the bar F are placed one upon each side of the standard C, in which position they are sup ported by a pin, G, which passes through the said standard and enters notches in the lower edges of the said bars F. The bars F are se cured in place upon the pin G by a slide con nected with the standard C, and which may be pushed down to rest upon the bars For drawn up to allow said bars to be removed. Hare the feed-boards, which are placed in inclined grooves in the inner sides of the bars F, and are adjustably secured in place by the bolts I and thumb-nuts J, said bolts I passing through the said bars F, as shown in the draw lings. K is the hopper, which rests upon the bars F, and is detachably secured in place by hooks, as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 1. L is a roller, the journals of which work in bearings in the bars F, and to which is at tached a series of projecting pins or spikes, which pass between similar pins or spikes projecting from the lower parts of the feed boards H, between the lower parts of which boards the Said roller Works. To the projecting end of one of the jour nals of the roller L is attached, or upon it is formed, a crank, M, to the crank-pin of which is pivoted a connecting-rod, N, either by forming a hole in said rod to receive the crank-pin or by forming a notch or loop in said rod to receive and ride upon said crank pin. This latter construction I prefer, as it allows the connecting-rod N to be conven iently detached and placed upon the hook O, attached to the frame of the planter, so that the machine may be taken from place to place without operating the dropping device. The forward end of the rod N is pivoted to the crank-pin of the crank P, formed upon the end of one of the journals of the wheel Q, the journals of which revolve in bearings in the standards R, attached to the forward end of the plow-beam. The standards R may be ad justably attached to the beam A, so that the wheel Q may be raised or lowered to regulate the depth at which the machine works in the ground. The dropping device heretofore described is designed for use in planting cot ton-seed, the spikes or pins drawing the seed out uniformly. S is a smallhopper placed beneath the bars F, and attached to the beams A, which receives the seed from the dropping device and guides it into the spout T, by which it is conducted to the ground just in the rear of the opening or furrowing plow D. U are two covering-spades, attached to the sides of the standards C in such positions as to force inward the Sides of the furrow and cover the seeds. The covering of the seeds is completed by the block or drag V, the lower side of which is concaved to give the proper - w E00,009. form to the row, and which is attached to the rear ends of the draft-rods W, the forward ends of which are attached to the sides of the plow beam A. The covering-block V is supported by the rods X, the lower ends of which are secured to said block V, and the upper ends of which have screw-threads cut upon them, pass up through holes in the bar Y, attached to the handles B and standard C, and have nuts placed upon them, so that by turning the said nuts in one or the other direction the block W may be raised or lowered to regulate the depth at which the seed is covered in the ground. When the machine is to be used for distrib uting guano or other fine fertilizer, the Spiked or toothed roller L and the spiked or toothed feed-boards H are detached, and the roller L. having cups or recesses formed in its face and being provided with a crank, and the feed boards H, provided with brushes, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, are used in their places. The latter dropping devices, L H', may also be used for dropping seeds other than cotton seed, the size of the recesses in the roller L'be ing regulated by the size or quantity of seed to be dropped. When the machine, is to be used for distributing a fertilizer, the covering device V W X U may be detached. The crank P of the wheel Q should be made shortel than the crank of the dropping-cylin del, So that the dropping cylinder or roller may not be revolved, but only turned or rocked through so much of a revolution as will transfer the seed or fertilizer to the guide-hopper S and conductor-spout T. Having thus described my invention, Iclaim as new and desire to secure by Letters Pat ent 1. The combination and arrangement of the detachable hopper K, detachable bars F, de tachable feed-boards H, whether provided with teeth or brushes, dropping roller or cyl inder L, whether provided with teeth or re cesses, guide-hopper S, conducting-spout T, crank M, connecting-rod N, crank P, and gage-wheel Q, with each other and with the plow-frame A B C, substantially as herein shown and described, and for the purpose set forth. 2. In combination with the hopper S, Spout T, opening-plow D, and the frame A B C, the covering-block V, when arranged to be ad justed vertically by means of rods a, bar Y, and screw-nuts, whereby said coverer main tains a fixed relation to the plows, as shown and described. JOSEPH ARRINGTON. Witnesses: H.

For a substance which requires 3,0000 of temperature to produce complete fusion may be kept at a temperature of 2,9000 for whole days in suc 'cession without becoming thoroughly melted, when the mere addition of only 1000 or 2000 of heat would, in that particular case, have pro duced a complete fusion of the substance ili a very short period of time. This well-known ... law of matteroperates most disadvantageously in those cases where the fusing-point of the substance to be operated upon closely ap proaches the limit of heat attainable by the is combustion of fuel by a draft or blast of air in ordinary, furnaces. . It is well known that atmospheric air and . . ..other gaseous fluids in a heated state acquire a still higher degree of temperature by their compression or condensation into a smaller space than they had previously occupied, such increase of temperature being in proportion to their reduced bulk, or to the number of atmos pheres forced into the space usually occupied by one. Now, l avail myself of this last-named property of gaseous fluids, and I construct furnaces of sufficient strength to withstand an internal pressure equal to two or more atmos plhe?es, and I retain in such furnaces the pro ducts of combustion under su clh an excess of pressurd over that of the external air as will produce the high temperature necessary for rapidly fusing malleable-iron and steel of any kind or quality. - I however desire it to be understood that I do not propose by this means to generate a greater quantity of heat by the combustion or uinon of a giyala ?uantity of carbon and oxy geal that is obtained by such nucans in well constructed furnaces. For the compression of the gaseous products of combustion within a furnacedoes not generate leat, but merely coir centrates into a smaller space and gives great er intensity to the same quantity or number of units of heat as would lhave existed in a more diffused state had not pressure been applied; hence wherever the temperature produced by the combustion offuel in ordinary furnaces hav ing a free escape to the climncy is suflicient for any desired object-as, for instance, the evap oration of water in steam-boilers-a loss would be sustained by compressing the gaseous pro ducts of combustion in such furnaces, for the . amount of engine-power required to compress the gases would exceed the power obtained from the increased quantity of steam gener ated in consequence of such compression, all other conditions being cqual; but whet) the highest temperature produced in ordinally far naces with a free escape is actually less, or when it only, by a small amount, exceeds the temperature absolutely required in any process, the case is entirely altered, and by retaining the heated products of combustion in a highly condensed or compressed state in a close cham ber or furnace I am enabled to obtain a much higher degree of temperature within the fur nace than would result from the same expendli w  fl00,008 3 - the plumbago mixed with clay may be formed intumolded bricks of the same composition as employed in the manufacture of plumbago crucibles. In either case it will be found more economical to partly line the furnace with or dinary fire-brick, and to form : ninternal skin or lining only of a few inches in thickness of the more expensive plumbago composition. It i is also desirable to use the ordinary fire-brick for the external part of the lining, because it is a much slower conductor of heat than plum. bago, and will better protect the outer metal shell from the effects of internal heat. When the cheapaess of theiron or steel pro duced is of more importance t'an the extreme purity or high quality of the metal, I prefer to use the cupola form of furnace, consisting of an upright fixed cylindical or slightly-conical vessel, with or without boshes, and having a dome or covered top, through which the metal to be melted and the fuel'used for that purpose are admitted by an iron door faced with fire brick, but having externally a close metal fit ting to prevent the escape of flame and heated gases. The door may be circular in form and be supported on a strong movable iron arm, ar ranged with a lever and cam, or with a worm wheel and screw, for the purpose of securing the door firmly in place. The iron arm also carries an upright cylinder of plate-iron hav. ing a movable bottom or grid. Into this cyl inder the charge of fuel and metal is put, so that on the removal of the door the cylinder is brought over the opening into the furnace. The bottom or grid is then withdrawn and the fuel and metal allowed to fall into the furnace, after which the door is again moved over the opening and secured firmly in place by nueans of the lever or screw. The blast should be shut off, or nearly so, during the charging of the furnace, after which it may be again turned on, and the operation of the furnace continued as before. In order to prevent an undue leakage of flame and heated gases from between the feed ing-door and the adjacent parts and their con sequent rapid destruction by the intense heat of the flame, I make a hollow channel around the door or frame, into which I convey steam or a blast of air, the pressure of which exceeds the pressure within the furnace, so that whatever leakage unavoidably occurs it is simply a leak age of steam or cold airinward, instead ofaleak age of flame outward from the furnace. I also cool the parts adjacent to all openings, where necessary, by the circulation of water through suitable channelsformed in those parts; and in furnaces requiring a very large feeding-door, in lieu of using the lever or screw arrangement, I secure the door in place by means of air, steam, or water pressure acting on the door by means df a piston with a greater force than is exerted on the door in an opposite direction by the press ure of the gases within the furnace, and thus secure the door firmly on its seat. The re moval of the pressure thus applied by opening - . . . . or reversing a valve allows the door to be re moved rapidly. There is also provided an es. cape-opening (or openings) for the products of combustion, the area of which is capable of al teration and adjustment by means of small cyl inders of fire-clay or other pieces of that mate. rial inserted in the opening for the purpose of reducing its area. I prefer to use several tuyeres for conveying the blast-among the fuel, and to make them of fire-clay or plumbago, although water-tuyeres may be employed in lieu thereof. The blast may be heated or cold; but I prefer to heat it to a high temperature, and the pressure of the blast may range, from two to six pounds per square itch (more or less) over the pressure of the confined gaseous products within the fur nace. The pressure of the latter will depend somewhat on the nature of the fuel employed and the more or less refractory character of the metal to be fused, and for these and other rea sons it may range from a few pounds to several atmospheres of pressure on each square-inch of the interior surface of the furnace. Some of the tuyeres employed direct the blast hori. zontally or upward, while others directitdown. ward at about an angle of thirty to forty-five degrees, so as to heat as much as possible the lower part of the furnace and the molten metal collected there. . When the tuyeres which dip downward are intended to heat the metal on the hearth, I place then sufficiently high up to cause the air to traverse a considerable depth of incandies. . cent fuel before reaching the surface of the metal; but if the tuyeres which are directed downward are placed only a short distance above the level of the fluid metal the blast will tend to refine or decarbonize the metal, so that the quantity of carbon taken up from the fuel may, if desired, be thus reduced. The horizon tal or upward tuyeres may be used simultane ously with them or they may be shut off dur ing the refining operation. . . . The tuyeres may also serve, when required, to convey any solid, fluid, or gaseous natters into the furnace that may be found desirable to act on the fuel or on the metal or upon the impurities contained therein-such as lime, car bonate of soda-chloride of calcium, or other: flux, as already known or practiced with other furnaces and in other processes of manufactur ing iron and steel. The mode and apparatus by which prefer to convey any solid substance in the form of powder along with the blast of air into the fur nace is shown in vertical stªtion at Figure 4, Sheet C. Iintroduce such matters into the close vessel in through a valvular opening, ac, which is closed by a bail, y, through which the screw 2 passes, and by means of which the valve is held down. The lower part of the vessel is conical, and is fitted onto the main blast-pipe by a flange, m, with which it communicates, A vertical spindle, p, passes up the center of the vessel, and, also passes out through the ' ' . . . ' · - 4 stuffing-box 1, formed in the cover n' of the vessel. The spindle p carries at its upper end a drum, r, by means of which rotary motion may becommunicated thereto. The lower end of this spindle is provided with a screw-blade, s, which reaches down into the blast-pipe a. The pipe u and stop-cock supply air to the upper part of the vessel n, by means of which the pressure above and below the powdered substancesis equalized, so that the powder may fall down into the blast-pipe as quickly or slowly as desired, depending on the velocity of the feeding-screw, and be carried forward into the furnace, and distributed among the lumps of incandescent fuel. A tapping-hole is also provided, as usual in cupola-furnaces, and a door for cieansing out the slags and for - repairing the furnace when necessary. There is also provided a means of taking the cupola in two parts, for the purpose of facili tating the lining of it with brick-work, or for lining it with moistened powdered thaterials to be rammed in around a suitable core or mold, as practiced in lining the Bessemer con verter. The flanges which unite the two parts I prefer to face in the lathe, so as to admit of then forming a sound joint when bolted to gether. . The upper portion of the cupola may be. lifted off with a crane, and will not require re lining so frequently as the lower part, which is acted on by the fused metal and slags. The tapping-hole I prefer to form by ram ming loam around a small truncated cone of well-burned fire-clay, which may be easily driven into the furnace by a blow of the tap ping-rod, and thus open the tap-hole rapidly, and of a size dependent on the diameter of the small end of the conical piece of clay. The metal, when melted, is thus drawn off into a ladle, in order to be transferred to anolds, as practiced with the casting of ingots or other masses of Bessemer steel. The addition of spiegeleisen or other alloys of iron, if they be used, may be made to the metal after it has been tapped from the fur nace into the castling-ladle; or the metal may be used alone or be mixed with ordinary molt en pig-iron in any desired proportion, and be used for casting a variety of articles requiring a foundry-iron of superior strength and hard iness; or it inay be applied to such other pur. pose:3 as its peculiar properties may render it suitable for. And in order that the mode of constructing and working the fixed bigh-pressure cupola. furnace may be fully understood, I have rep resented the same on Sheet A of the drawings. h(reunto annexed, where-- Figure 1 is a vertical section on the line AB (of Pig. 2.

They are in serted through the square iron frames d, which are secured by countersunk rivets to the sluell a, and are beveled on the inside. The outer ends of the tuyeres c are enlarged or made taper, and the space between these enlarged parts aid the beveled sides of the frames d is calked with iron-cement, (iron borings and sal-ammo niac,) so that the escape of gases from the fur inace around the tuyeres is prevented, and the pressure of the flanges e of the blast-pipes f against the enlarged ends of the tuyeres is also prevented fron forcing the tuyeres c into the furnace by reason.of their enlarged ends and the iron-cement around them, while the blast-pipe flange e, by being securely bolted to the i un frannes d, also prevent the internal pressure acting on the ends of the tuyeres from driving them outward. The blast-pipesfare bolted to the main air-trunk g by flanges f*. The air-trunk g may, if desired, be placed below the level of the floor, and in that case the pipeg, conducting air from any suitable blast-engine, will be more couveniently situ ated. Blast- engines such as are generally employed in the Bessemer process are well adapted for this process. . An equilibrium-valve is placed in the main pipeg, conveniently near to the furnace, by means of which the blast may be turned on or off, or moderated from time to time, as desired. The feeding-door of these furnaces is so small that it is necessary to provide a special means of entering the furnace for relining the interior . from time to time. For the purpose of giving convenient access to all parts of the interior I divide the furnace into two parts by massive angle-flanges h h, which are faced so as to form. an air-tight joint, and are secured together by bolts and nuts, as shown ath.

So in like manner steam or water used for cooling any part of the furnace may be eonveyed to it. In order that the mode in which I construct high-pressure cupola-furnaces movable on axes may be fully understood, I have represented the same on Sheets B and C of the annexed drawings, where Fig. 1, Sheet, B, is a vertical section on the line A B of Fig. 1, Sheet C; and Fig. 2, Sheet B, is a front elevation of the furnace. Fig. 3, Sheet B, is a vertical section, showing the mode of admitting air and water through the trun nion or axis. Fig. 1, Sheet C, is a plan, and Fig. 2, Sheet C, is a horizontal section of the same furnace ontle line CD of Fig. 1, Sheet B. : In this modification of the cupola-furnace the mode of constructing the outer shell of riv eted plates, its lining of fire-brick, plumbago, organister, and the modes of making and fix ing the tuyeres are all identical with those al ready described in reference to the fixed cu pola - furnace shown on Sheet A of the an nexed drawings, as hereinbefore described. So, also, it will be seen that the whole of the crown or upper part of the movable cupola furnace, and the crane-arm and crane-post, furnace-door, worm-and-screw arrangement, and the feeding-cylinder are precisely like those before shown and described, and will therefore be understood without again repeating a de scription of them. I have, however, indicatedl the several parts of the apparatus which have been before described by the same letters of reference as were used to denote them on Sheet A, so that no mistake may be inade as to the nature or purpose of any such parts; and in describing the several parts of the movable furnace which are peculiar to it and not before described, I have used figures instead of let ters of reference to denote such parts. The cupola, movable on axes, may be support ed on strong standards resting on the ground at each side; but as such standards would be more or less in the way, I prefer to support the cupola on the cantilevers 1, which project from a solid wall, 2, forming part of a chimney or furnace, into which the gaseous matfers are projected with considerable velocity. The trun nions 3 and 4 project from a strong iron flanged band or trunnion-ring, 5, extenditugaround the cupola, and to which the lower angle-flange, h, is boited, and thus the two parts of the cupola are suspended. The trunnion3 extends beyond the plumber-block. 1, which is formed on the end of the cautilever 1, and is provided with a stuffing-box and gland, 6, through which the blast-pipe 7 enters. This is best seen in sec tion at Fig. 3, Sheet B. A smallpipe, 8, passes through a staffing-box formed at 9 on the elbow of the blast-pipe. The pipe 8 then passes up ward through the trunnion at 8, and is for the supply of water to the ring p, which forms the mouth of the furnace. The pipe 8, after passing some distance beneath the floor, bises. up and is connected with an elevated reser voir, for the supply of watertothering p. After circulating through the ring p the water de scends by the pipe 11 through the axis 4, and by means of the pipe 12 is conveyed away. The blast of air, after passing through the trun nion 3, descends by means of the pipe 13 into a cast-iron box, 14, secured to the lowerplates of the cupola. From this box the pipes.ff convey the blast into the tuyeres before de scribed in reference to the fixed cu pola upon , the upper part of the lorick-work. A stage is formed by the iron plate 16, which is supported by upright standards 17, which rest on the cantilevers 1. The stage thus formed is sur rounded by a railing, 18, and on it the work man is stationed who supplies fuel and metal to the furnace. A similar feeding-stage may be employed for the supply of fuel and metal to the fixed cupola hereinbefore described, but which is not shown in the drawings. A stage or standing-place should also be provided in both cases for the use of the workman who op erates the crane-arm and opens and shuts the furnace-door wil en required. The motion of the vessel on its axis may be effected by ordinary, spur-gearing in connec tion with a revolving shaft slowly turned by engine-power and capable of being thrown ita and out of gear or reversed by the ordinary means used for such purposes; or the cupola. may be moved by means of hydrostatic press ure, as usually applied for giving motion to Bessemer converting-vessels. I have shown a spur-wheel, 19, on the axis 4 of the cupola for this "urpose, but have omitted in the draw. . ings the hydrostatic apparatus, which is now well known and understood. In cupola-furnaces movable on axes the or dinary tapping-hole is replaced by an opening of much larger size, made in a piece of fire brick, and shown at 20. This piece is fitted. into a ring, 21, leaving a conical space between the fire-clay and ring 21. This space is calked with iron-borings, and not only, serves to pre vent the escape of gaseous matters from the furnace, but, a conical part being formed on the fire-clay piece, the latter is prevented from be ing forced out of the furnace by internal press ure. The ring 21 is secured to the shell of the furnace by countersunk rivets, and the front face of it is fitted to an iron cover, 23, by means of which the openingisclosed. An arch-shaped piece of iron, 24, falls into two notches made to receive its outer ends, and a screw, 25, passes. through a central boss in the arched piece. By means of this screw and its cross-handle the cover 23 is firmly held in place. The end 8 w 100003 ; . of the screw is formed into aloose cone, fitting other fuel may, however, be employed, and also , so as to give some play and allow the cover to lime or other fluxes hitherto known or em. ployed for keeping the slags or cinder in a fiuid fit freely in place.

I would also remark that the addi tion of spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese, when employed for the purpose of altering the de gree of carburation of the metal or for remov ing any oxgen therefrom, may be most advan tageously used after the molten metal has run ott of the furnace by putting it in a heated granular form, or as a fluid into the ladle. which receives the charge of molten metal from the furnace. I would further remark that the choice of the several kinds of metal before named for melting and obtaining cast-steel and homoge neous malleable iron will depend on their known quality or the local cost, and on the quality of the product desired to be obtained The manufacturer will, for these several rea sons, also employ them separately, or mixed in such proportions as he may think fit or as their nature and properties may render neces sary or desirable. I also desireitto be understood that furnaces constructed so as to have their temperature raised by the compression or condensation of the gaseous products of combustion within them, as herein described, may also be employed in fusing any of the more or less malleable kinds of iron and steel before enumerated and com bining there with pig-iron or other carburet of iron in such proportions as to form a sort of . steely cast-iron or mixed metal suitable for casting railway-crossings and wheels, bellsan vil-blocks, stamp-heads, guns, mortars, project iles, and other articles where a metal stronger and harder than ordinary cast-iron is required. My improved furnaces may also be advan tageously employed to melt any pig or other carburet of iron to be afterward converted into steel or malleable iron by the now well-known Bessemer process, and also in such cases where a carburetofiron difficult of fusión is employed, aud also in all cases where the melted iron is required to be of a very high temperature. I have hereinbefore described two modifica tions of the cupola-furnace, in both of which the metal to be fused and the fuel employed to fuse it are mixed and occupy one common cham ber. I however desire it to be understood that my invention also consists in melting steel or malleable iron of any of the kinds or qualities hereinbefore enumerated when contained in fire-clay, plumbago, or other crucibles, and also infusing the before-named metallic substances, or either of them, on the hearth of a reverbera tory furnace arranged for working with the pro ducts of combustion under pressure, as in the cupola-furnaces hereinbefore di escribed. In constructing furnaces in which crucibles are to be used prefer to make the fuel-chain ber cylindrical and to supply it with blast in a similar manner to that already described in ref. erence to the cupola-furnace. The upper part of the furnace is enlarged, and an annular seat or space is formed around the fuel-chamber, on which the crucibles are placed. The furnace is covered with a dome-shaped roof, and several small openings are left around the furnace for the escape offlame, suitable doors being formed in the dome or roof for the removal of the cruci bles, the regulation of the pressure of the gas eous products and the feeding of the fuel be ing arranged in a manner similar to that al ready described in reference to the cupola-far nace; or the dome or top of the furmace may be made to turn round, and all the crucibles may in that case belifted out through a single open ing, which is brought in succession over each crucible. I desire it to be understood that when cruci bles are employed in my improved furnace both cast-steeland homogeneous malleable iron, and also any alloys of iron and manganese that have been or may be made in trucibles con tained in ordinary furnaces, may in like man ner be made in my improved furnaces, whether such cast-steel or homogeneous malleable iron, or alloys of Iron with manganese or othermet als betheresult of simple fusion orbe produced - . . . . . . . . . . . object. i00,00 by the chemical action or reaction of an y ma terials put into them for that purpose. - In order that the mode of constructing bi gl? : pressure crucible-furnaces employed for the fusion of malleableiron or steel or alloys of iron with other metals may be fully understood, I have represented two methods of effecting this 11 cibles rest I however prefer to make óf large fire-brick lumps, as they form a more solid bed for the pots than ganister or other similar lin ling.

Before turning on...the blast to the furnace all these screws inust be brought to bear firmly on the upper side of the hoop, by which means the pressure within the furnace is unable to raise the dome from its seat. So soon, however, as the workman judges that the metal in his crucibles is in a state of complete fusion, he will shut off or moderate the blast for a short time, in order to cool down the pots, as usual, before 'teaming.” He will then slacken all the screws B, raise the fur nace-door by means of the screw apparatus, and swing it round so as to afford easy access to the crucible immediately beneath the open ing, which he will lift out with his tongs, as usual. By then turning on a little blast to the channel c the pressure of it, acting on the lower surface of the ring e, will cause the dome to either entirely float off its seat, or by mod erating the pressure he can relieve it of so much only of the weight pressing on the ring c as to allow it to be moved round with great freedom. Six or more small guide -rollers, D, are mounted on studs which project down ward from the ring e, The rollers run in con tact with the inner face of the ring c, and thus insure the proper position of the dome, on the upper side of which several snugs or staples, E, are riveted, into which a staff, F, can be in serted, for the purpose of turning round the dome of the furnace, and thus giving access to each crucible in succession. The crucibles may again be replaced when emptied, after which the furnace may be supplied with fresh fuel, the crucibles charged with metal, and the screws B tightened down, and the furnace-door again brought over the opening and secured there. The operation of the furinace maythén be con tinued under such an amount of internal press ure as is found best adapted for the economical fusion of the particular quality of metal en - ployed. At Fig. 2, Sheet D, I have shown another modification of the high-pressure crucible-fur nace, the outershell, G, of which is constructed With riveted plates, and is lined throughout with fire-brick or other refractory material, H., the tuyeres and the mode by which they are secured and connected to the blast-pipe being the same as in the furnace last herein described. In lieu, however, of the movable dome for giv ing access to the several crucibles I, four or other convenient number of openings, J, are made in the done or crown of the furnace, through which the crucibles may be placed and removed when required. A pair of tongs with the joint formed on one side of the claws will allow the workman to place through the opening one crucible to the right hand of the opening and the next one to the left, and finally he can place one centrally between the other fwo and directly beneath the opening, so that || the four openings into the furnace will suffice for the placing of twelve crucibles, and also serve to introduce the fuel, when required. A lump of molded fire-clay, K, having a ring in serted in it, is placed in the opening J, and above it is placed a strofig iron plate, Iu, having its edge truly formed into a cone. A flanged ring, M, is riveted to the plates of the dome, and is made conical on its interior surface, to fit the plate L, around which a little luting may be put, as practiced in keeping the joints tight at the mouth of gas-retorts. Two strong staples, N, are riveted to the crown-plates. Through these staples the iron bar P is passed. A screw, O, passes through this bar, which is employed to bind the plate L, firmly on its seat. The openings Q Q, for the escape of the products of combustion, may be placed on the sides of the furinace opposite to a fue or chinney-open ing; or they may be fitted into the crown of the furnace, as hereinbefore described in refer. ence to the crucible-furnace with a revolving dome, and which latter form of crucibles I prefer for the purposes of my invention. In constructing furnaces in which the metal is to be fused on the hearth of the furnace, in the manner of reverberatory furnaces, the same general arrangement of fire-chamber and tuyeres may be used as that already described, the roof or arch of the furnace being a short distance only above the hearth, the escape of gaseous matters at the opposite end to the fire chamber and the regulation of the pressure of the combined gaseous products, and also the feeding in of the materials and fuel, being ar. anged in a similar manner to that hereinbe. fore described in reference to the cupola-fur The 1mode of constructing high-pressure re verberatory furnaces for the fusion of mal leable iron and steel, or other carburets of iron, is represented in Sheet D of the annexed draw ings, where Fig. 3 is a longitudinal vertical section on the line AB of Fig. 4, and Fig. 4 . is a vertical cross-section on the line CD of Fig. 3, showing the fire-chamber in elevation, the feeding-door and its appendages being omitted in this view. a is the outer shell of the furnace, formed of stout iron or steel, both plates well riveted to gether and calked air-tight at all laps and joints. The end plates, a *, are further supported by stout angle gasset-plates a. The fire-box end. of the shell a is in the form of a vertical cyl inder, and is strengthened at bottom by stout T-angles riveted across it at a. The upper part of the shell of the fire-box is strengthened by a hamassive loop of iron, b, into which nu merous screwed studs e are tapped, by means of which and the nuts fitted to them the dome or crown of the shell is held securely in its seat. This mode of fixing on the crown is adopted to facilitate the relining of the furnace from . tilpne to time. The body of the furnace is oval, in cross section. The oval part at a is riveted up to . (e... . - - -  . . . . 10000 ? corresponding opening in the cylindrical fire. box, and terminates at the angle-flanged, to . which it is also riveted. The end piece, a, has a similar angle-flange, e, riveted to it. This part of the furnace is supported on a cast-iron standard, f, by which it is retained in position when the central part, a, is taken away on a truck for the purpose of being relined. There are also angle-fanges, g and l, riveted to the central part, a, all of which flanges, d, e.g., and l, are truly faced in the lathe, so as to be firmly bolted together and form a close air-tight junction of the differelit parts of the furnace, capable of resisting the great internal press ure of the gaseous matters confined within the furnace, and at the same time admitting the central part of the outer shell being removed, and thus affords facility for relining the fur nace when required, and which lining may be readily effected by inserting a properly-shaped wooden pattern into the part to be lined and ramming in the moistened ganister around it. The orifices of the tuyeres are shown at i. They are formed of fire-clay or plumbago, and are secured air-tight to the outer shell of the furnace, and connected to the tuyere-pipes in the same manner as laerein before described and shown with reference to the tuyeres and pipes employed in the cupola-furnace repre sented on Sheet A of the anexed drawings. An opening for running out slag from the fire-chamberjis shown atk.

This method is shown in elevation as attached to the reverberatory fur-. nace on Sheet D, and is also shown at Fig. 6 on Sheet C of the annexed drawings, partly in section, and in plan at Fig. 7 on the same sheet. The same letters of reference are used where : the parts are repeated in these figures. tis the crane-post, with a tubular passage, tiº, formed in it. ... it is the foot-step in which the crane- lost moves.

At y'another pinjoint is formed, and by means of the links D the beam is attached to . the piston E, which is made air-tight by pack- . ing-rings, in the usual manner. The opposite end of the leam y is jointed to the upper side of ?urnace door by the joint-piece Gand pin I. In the lower part of the metal of the cylinder a small cock, J, is provided, having a very small way through it, to prevent the too-sud den passage of air or otlher fluid into the cylin tler. A small hole is drilled horizontally through the metal forming the lower part of the cylinder, and at right angles to the axis of the cock J, so that the cock may act two ways that is, it may discharge air from beneath the piston when turned into the position shown in Fig. 6 by the horizontal passage before referred to, and by reversing it the air passing up through the crane-post will be conveyed be neath the piston, and by means of the pressure so exerted the piston will rise and the beamor levery will force the furnace-door firmly onto its seat. By this arrangement the opening and closing of the furnace-door may be rapidly effected with the labor only of turning the small stop-cock J. The piston requires to travel only about one inch in order to lift the door sufficiently high to admitofits being moved on one side. The feed ing-cylinder will thus be brought over the open ing an and discharge its fuel into the furnace. The feeding - cylinder is, however, omitted in Figs. 3 and 4, Sheet ID, and in Figs. 6 and 7, Sheet C; but it is made and attached to the crane-arm in the manner shown in Figs. 1 and 2, Sheet A. I would also remark that, although have shown the arrangement for closing the furnace door in thereverberatory furnace and the screw and worm-wheel arrangement as applied to the cupola-furnace, it will be obvious that either mode may be employed in both kinds of fur nace. The exit-passage for the gaseous products of combustion (shown at M) is molded in fire clay and well burned. A joint is formed be tween it and the ring N with rust-cement, with which the joint is calked.

Y. Letters Patent No. 100,005, dated February 22, 1870. IMPROVEMENT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF waTER-Proof FABRICS FROM wasTE RUBBER. The Schedule referred to in these setters Patent and making part of the same To all avion, it may concern: Be it known that I, MARCAR WAHRAM BEYLIKGY, of the city, gounty, and State of New York, have in vented a new and useful improvement in the Manu facture of Water-Proof Fabrics from Refuse Rubber; and I do hereby, declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, which will enable otile's skilled in the art to make and use the sane. The object of this invention is to utilize the shav ings and refuse of rubber goods in the production of a new and useful fabric. It is well known that ordinary vulcanized caoutchouc ceases to soluble by the same liquids which dissolved it before, but that such liquids will only cause the rub ber to swell and soften. When the liquid is evapo rated the rubber will become as hard as before, and re sume the original form. When the vulcalized rubber is for a number of days exposed to a temperature of about 2500 Fahrenheit, it undergoes some structural transformation, loosing its rigidity and tellacity, and becoming an adhesive mass isoluble in water and alcolhol, partially soluble in ether, but wholly soluble in heated tupentine oil, benzole, caloutchoucine, and other essential oils. This softened rubber which I shall call “caoutchou cite,” to distinguish it from the ordinary rubber, of whiclh it appears to be only all isolmeric modification, is suscep tible of vulcanization by any of the well-known pro cesses of sulphurizing. It only requires higher tem perature or more time than for the vulcanization of ordinary rubber. The product will be as little adhe sive and soluble, but less tough, as ordinary vulcall ized rubber. The cauutcloucite may be vulcanized like ca.out. chout: at ordinary temperature under the action of chlo ride of sulphur diluted with sixty and even a hundred times its weight of sulphide of carbon. This can, however, not be dune if the caoutchoucite is dissolved in turpentine oil unless reactive meditlin is in large excess. The caoutchoucite is left for a number of days in the oil of turpentine, the same being mixed with a . strong solution of potassa or soda. The rubber then coagulates into a jelly, which separates an elastic aid sutaewhat tenacious pellicle on boiling the mix ture. This fict shows that under some circumstances the caoutchoucite may be vulcanized with its original quantity of sulphur at a comparatively lower temper ature than is otherwise required. The said properties of the caoutclhoucite of being adhesive and soluble in many ordinary dissolvents, as well as the facility of vulcanizing in the ordinary man ner, and thus to obtain the properties of collinon vul canized rubber will make it a valuable article for many , purposes, but especially for the manufacture of water proof fabrics and as water-proof layers for fabrics. The refuse rulober can thus be utilized in soline inn portant manufactures, while at present they are en tirely lost in vast quantities. The following is a description of the method of vul canizing the cauutchoucite and of applying it to fabrics: The shavings or any kind of destroyed fabrics or re fuse of ordinary vulcanized rubber are first cut into small pieces, and put into a vessel with so much recti fied oil of turpentine that they are entirely submerged in the liquid. After the rubber has been covered with its lid, heat is applied by suitable means to produce a constant temperature of about 230°Fahrenheit. While heated, the mixture is stirred by a rapid motion of an agitator of suitable construction, rotated by suitable means. The rubber decreases in bulk and finally dissolves in tle oil; more rubber is then added, and the digestion continued until the dissolution is accomplished, which will last no longer than ten or twelve hours. The ves sel is then connected with the condensing chamber of a still, in order to recover most of the oil of turpentine. This distillation cannot be carried on at the tempera ture corresponding to the boiling point of the oil of turpentine in the ordinary condition of atmospheric pressure, experience having shown that in that tem perature the two kinds of hydrocarbon which consti tute the rubber are. separated, the less soluble part being thrown to the bottom, the rubber having lost its quality, and the components being no more uni formly diffused throughout the whole mass. The distillation should therefore be performed at a temperature not exceeding 230°Fahrenheit, in a cor responding vacuum. The process may be greatly sim plified by distilling with steam, which runs through the boiling vessel, evaporates the oil of turpentine, which separates spontaneously on condensing the va porous mixture. But the consumption of fuel will in this case be far more considerable for a given amount of rubber, than what is necessary for the motion of an air-pump. The residue of distillation is caoutchoucite varnish, more or less pure according to the quality of materials employed. ly the foregoing process, the transformation of vul canized caoutchouc into caoutchoucite is considerably facilitated, and may be still more accelerated by the addition of dissolvent agents in place of mere expos ure to the dry leat. This method has still another advantage of purifying the rubber and separating it from the foreign matters with which many fabrics are mixed. For this purpose the solution is strained and decanted before it is aliowed to concentrate. The sep co,005 bon; the second with alcohol containing a shall quan tity of ammonia, and the last with water. The fabrics remain about ten minutes in each reservoir, and they are by the contents of the same vulcanized and washed. Finally they are dried by exposure to dry heat of about 1159 Fallenleit. The object of the above combinationisin the first place the recovering of the sulphide of carbon in distilling the alcohol after it has been saturated. The alcohol will be also recovered by distilling the water, so that the fabrics may at once be dried. The rubber layer swelled by sulphide of carbon cannot be dried speedily, as the expansive power of that fluid would burst the layer and injure the fabrics. For want of sulphide of carbon, chloroform or crude benzole may be used, and methylic alcoliol may be used for ethylic. Having thus described my invention, I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent 1. The herein-described method of utilizing refuse rubber by applying it to the manufacture of water proof fabrics, as set forth. 2. The regained rubber refuse called caoutcluoncite, obtained substantially in the nanner herein shown and described. 3. The herein-described method of recovering the solvent of chloride of sulphur after the same has been used for vulcanizing rubber, as set forth. The above specification of my invention signed by me this 29th day of IDecember, 1869. MARCAR WAHRAM BEYLIKGY. s - - - - Witnesses: GEO. W. MABEE, ALEX. F. ROBERTS. aration of coloring matters is unnecessary for black colored varnishes, so that destroyed rubber shoes may be regarded as the most economical black-coloring ma terial. The caoutchoucite may as aforementioned be vul canized either by hot or cold way. To apply, the first process, the best way is to effect the complete separa tion of two components of caoutchoucite, in order to perform the vulcanization at lower temperature and in slhorter time. For this purpose, as soon as the dissolu tion of rubber in the oil of turpentine is completed and the stirrer arrested and the boiler connected with still, the temperature is raised to the boiling-point of turpentine oil, and the varnish kept in full ebullition for about half an hour and left to cool. After the in soluble part is precipitated, which is completed in two or three days, the clear solution is drawn off and sub mitted to concentration in the manner above described. The solution is, however, previously mixed with three pounds of sulphur for every hundred weight of rubber employed. When the varnish has acquired the necessary thickness it is removed from the boiler. After the fabrics have been overlaid with this war nish, they are submitted to heat, which is gradually increased from 212° to 390 Fahrenheit during about one hour. Only that side of the cloth fabric which is covered with the rubber layer should be exposed to the leat. For the vulcanization in ordinary temperature, the caoutchoucite is reduced to a thick varnish, no sepa ration of its ingredients nor addition of sulphur being required. After the fabrics are overlaid with and dried, they are immersed successively in three reservoirs, which are connected with each other; the first being filled with a mixture of one part of chloride of sulphur with eighty or one hundred parts of sulphide of car

BowERs, of the city of Harrisburg, in the county of Dauphin, and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new and use ful improvement, consisting of a "Cellar-Hoistor El evator” and "Cellar Stairs or Steps”'combined. The construction of the same, and manner of com bination and arrangement, I will proceed to describe. The drawing represents a perspective view of the device in position for operation. The essential feature of novelty in-this invention consists in providing a compact, convenient, and pow elful hoisting macline, that will always be ready for use, and coubining the sane with cellar stairs or steps, substantially as follows: The uprights or side supports B B” of the stairs are made of timber sufficiently strong for the purpose. They are given a proper degree of inclination from a vertical position, and rest upon a proper foundation, their üpper ends being securely fastened to the sill D. The Said pieces B B have their front edges grooved or chanieled out, as seen at u u in the drawing. These grooves are intended to act as a guide-way for tle lloisting table A. Said table is made substantially as shown in the drawing. That portion of the frame-work of the table A that bears against the pieces B B has tongues formed upon it to enter into and slide easily in the grooves in said pieces when in position, thus retaining and guiding tlie table when it is loisted or lowered. Upon each side of the frame of table A, at a point, s, ropes or chains b b are rigidly securell by their ends. Said ropes or chains are carried up over the groeved wheels n. n. These wheels are secured to the outside surfaces of the pieces B B, and near their up per ends, in such a manuer as to permit them to turn íreely upon the studs or bolts that. secure them in place. The ropes or chains b b are made fast to the barrel shaft c of the winch or crane-gear. Said winch or huisting gear is constructed substantially as is shown in the drawing, and consists of a barrel shaft, c, and driving shaft d, that are supported by suitable hang (IS. Upon one end of the shaft c a large gear-wheel, o, is secured. A small pinión, r, that is fastened to the driving shaft d, meshes into the wheel o, as is shown. Upon the opposite end of the shaft d a crank, e, is secured. A ratchet-wheel, i, in which the click or pawl p catches, is also fastened in place upon the shaft d, im mediately in the rear of the crank e. i . - The supporting hangers are connected so that the entire winch is in a compact and portable form. It . is bolted or otherwise properly secured to the joists or other suitable timbers in-the cellar, overhead, so that the handle of the crank e is accessible from the floor. The position given the said winch should be directly opposite to or in a straight line in the rear of the cellar stairs, so that.-the ropes b b will train in a cor reet mannel. The stepsia a a, &c., should be set back a short distance from the front edge of the uprights B B, so as to permit the table A to pass their front edges readily. The uprights B B' should have their lower ends let into the bottom of the cellar up to the dotted line E F. The lower portion or frame-work of the table A should also bé sunk a similar depth, a proper excava tion being made to permit the same. This should be walled or planked upon its sides, so as to prevent dirt from falling in and obstructing the table. This plan of construction will bring the top of the: table A on a line with the bottom of the cellar. In fact, if it is floored, the table will form a portion of the floor. In using this device, weighty articles can be placed upon the table with great ease, either for elevating tlem from the cellar floor to the street, or for lower , ing them from the street into the cellar. By the operation of the winch C, the hoisting and lowering is rendered easy and secure, as the ratchet wheel acts as a guard to prevent slipping, and enables the operator to arrest the ascent ordescent of the ar ticle at any point desired. The frame-work of the hoisting table A may be provided with small wheels or rollers, with flanges, to run upon the front faces of the uprights B B. The grooves in the faces of the uprights can then be dis pensed with, as well as the tongues upon the frame. I do not desire to claim broadly the general appli cation of a winch to an elevator, as I am aware that it has been so applied; but What I do clain as new, of my invention, and de sire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States, 1S The peculiar combination and arrangement of the elevating table A, stair upriglits B B, and winch C, the whole constructed and operating substantially as herein set forth. .. HENRY L.
