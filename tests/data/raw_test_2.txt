BEUGLER, of Wil liamsport, in the county of Lycoming, and State of Pennsylvania, have made a new and valuable In provenient to supercede the necessity of building strong and heavy foundations to secure Crank-Shafts in a fixed position, by allowing the crank end of the shaft to vibrate freely and accommodate itself to any throw or side movement caused by rapid motion, leavy la bor, &c.; and I do declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, reference being had to the accompanying drawing forming part of this specification. To enable others skilled in the art to perform with my invention, I will proceed to describe its construc tion and operation. To use my invention for placing the crank-shaft in position for use, First, construct a frame, A, suitable for the pur poses intended to be accomplished by the power used. Second, hang to it the fiane B by bolts or ball-joints C; into the frame B place the boxes D; into the boxes D insert the crank-shaft E; on the end of the crank-shaft E place tie pulley F, the center of which tnust be on line with bolts or ball-joints C C; on the other end of the shaft place the crank-wheel and wrist pin, G. G, on which attach the pitman H. The dotted line I between C C represents the cen . ' . . . . . . . . . . ters of joint CC and pulley, F, on shaft E. The crank wle G must have sufficient counterbalance to equal the weight of the driven parts attached to the wrist pin G, which, when properly done will throw all vi brations laterally on box D, which when allowed to moye or vibrate laterally, as herein described, will do away with all other foundations for crank-shafts, ex cept to support the machine and work. Having described a swing frame with the box D firmly attached thereto, and the crank-shaft E placed therein to attain the object desired, I do not wish to be confined to that particular form of machinery, as the same may be attained by allowing the box D. on the crank end of the shaft to slide in a slot prepared for it, or other devices, to allow the shaft to vibrate laterally. What I claim, and desire to secure by Letters Pat ent, is The application to crank-shafts of a swinging or slid ing-box which will allow the crank-shaft to vibrate freely of its own accord, as herein described. Witness my hand and seal in the matter of my ap plication for Letter's Patent on improvemeut in lang ing crank-shafts. JAMES M.

Y. Letters Patent No. 100,005, dated February 22, 1870. IMPROVEMENT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF waTER-Proof FABRICS FROM wasTE RUBBER. The Schedule referred to in these setters Patent and making part of the same To all avion, it may concern: Be it known that I, MARCAR WAHRAM BEYLIKGY, of the city, gounty, and State of New York, have in vented a new and useful improvement in the Manu facture of Water-Proof Fabrics from Refuse Rubber; and I do hereby, declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, which will enable otile's skilled in the art to make and use the sane. The object of this invention is to utilize the shav ings and refuse of rubber goods in the production of a new and useful fabric. It is well known that ordinary vulcanized caoutchouc ceases to soluble by the same liquids which dissolved it before, but that such liquids will only cause the rub ber to swell and soften. When the liquid is evapo rated the rubber will become as hard as before, and re sume the original form. When the vulcalized rubber is for a number of days exposed to a temperature of about 2500 Fahrenheit, it undergoes some structural transformation, loosing its rigidity and tellacity, and becoming an adhesive mass isoluble in water and alcolhol, partially soluble in ether, but wholly soluble in heated tupentine oil, benzole, caloutchoucine, and other essential oils. This softened rubber which I shall call “caoutchou cite,” to distinguish it from the ordinary rubber, of whiclh it appears to be only all isolmeric modification, is suscep tible of vulcanization by any of the well-known pro cesses of sulphurizing. It only requires higher tem perature or more time than for the vulcanization of ordinary rubber. The product will be as little adhe sive and soluble, but less tough, as ordinary vulcall ized rubber. The cauutcloucite may be vulcanized like ca.out. chout: at ordinary temperature under the action of chlo ride of sulphur diluted with sixty and even a hundred times its weight of sulphide of carbon. This can, however, not be dune if the caoutchoucite is dissolved in turpentine oil unless reactive meditlin is in large excess. The caoutchoucite is left for a number of days in the oil of turpentine, the same being mixed with a . strong solution of potassa or soda. The rubber then coagulates into a jelly, which separates an elastic aid sutaewhat tenacious pellicle on boiling the mix ture. This fict shows that under some circumstances the caoutchoucite may be vulcanized with its original quantity of sulphur at a comparatively lower temper ature than is otherwise required. The said properties of the caoutclhoucite of being adhesive and soluble in many ordinary dissolvents, as well as the facility of vulcanizing in the ordinary man ner, and thus to obtain the properties of collinon vul canized rubber will make it a valuable article for many , purposes, but especially for the manufacture of water proof fabrics and as water-proof layers for fabrics. The refuse rulober can thus be utilized in soline inn portant manufactures, while at present they are en tirely lost in vast quantities. The following is a description of the method of vul canizing the cauutchoucite and of applying it to fabrics: The shavings or any kind of destroyed fabrics or re fuse of ordinary vulcanized rubber are first cut into small pieces, and put into a vessel with so much recti fied oil of turpentine that they are entirely submerged in the liquid. After the rubber has been covered with its lid, heat is applied by suitable means to produce a constant temperature of about 230°Fahrenheit. While heated, the mixture is stirred by a rapid motion of an agitator of suitable construction, rotated by suitable means. The rubber decreases in bulk and finally dissolves in tle oil; more rubber is then added, and the digestion continued until the dissolution is accomplished, which will last no longer than ten or twelve hours. The ves sel is then connected with the condensing chamber of a still, in order to recover most of the oil of turpentine. This distillation cannot be carried on at the tempera ture corresponding to the boiling point of the oil of turpentine in the ordinary condition of atmospheric pressure, experience having shown that in that tem perature the two kinds of hydrocarbon which consti tute the rubber are. separated, the less soluble part being thrown to the bottom, the rubber having lost its quality, and the components being no more uni formly diffused throughout the whole mass. The distillation should therefore be performed at a temperature not exceeding 230°Fahrenheit, in a cor responding vacuum. The process may be greatly sim plified by distilling with steam, which runs through the boiling vessel, evaporates the oil of turpentine, which separates spontaneously on condensing the va porous mixture. But the consumption of fuel will in this case be far more considerable for a given amount of rubber, than what is necessary for the motion of an air-pump. The residue of distillation is caoutchoucite varnish, more or less pure according to the quality of materials employed. ly the foregoing process, the transformation of vul canized caoutchouc into caoutchoucite is considerably facilitated, and may be still more accelerated by the addition of dissolvent agents in place of mere expos ure to the dry leat. This method has still another advantage of purifying the rubber and separating it from the foreign matters with which many fabrics are mixed. For this purpose the solution is strained and decanted before it is aliowed to concentrate. The sep co,005 bon; the second with alcohol containing a shall quan tity of ammonia, and the last with water. The fabrics remain about ten minutes in each reservoir, and they are by the contents of the same vulcanized and washed. Finally they are dried by exposure to dry heat of about 1159 Fallenleit. The object of the above combinationisin the first place the recovering of the sulphide of carbon in distilling the alcohol after it has been saturated. The alcohol will be also recovered by distilling the water, so that the fabrics may at once be dried. The rubber layer swelled by sulphide of carbon cannot be dried speedily, as the expansive power of that fluid would burst the layer and injure the fabrics. For want of sulphide of carbon, chloroform or crude benzole may be used, and methylic alcoliol may be used for ethylic. Having thus described my invention, I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent 1. The herein-described method of utilizing refuse rubber by applying it to the manufacture of water proof fabrics, as set forth. 2. The regained rubber refuse called caoutcluoncite, obtained substantially in the nanner herein shown and described. 3. The herein-described method of recovering the solvent of chloride of sulphur after the same has been used for vulcanizing rubber, as set forth. The above specification of my invention signed by me this 29th day of IDecember, 1869. MARCAR WAHRAM BEYLIKGY. s - - - - Witnesses: GEO. W. MABEE, ALEX. F. ROBERTS. aration of coloring matters is unnecessary for black colored varnishes, so that destroyed rubber shoes may be regarded as the most economical black-coloring ma terial. The caoutchoucite may as aforementioned be vul canized either by hot or cold way. To apply, the first process, the best way is to effect the complete separa tion of two components of caoutchoucite, in order to perform the vulcanization at lower temperature and in slhorter time. For this purpose, as soon as the dissolu tion of rubber in the oil of turpentine is completed and the stirrer arrested and the boiler connected with still, the temperature is raised to the boiling-point of turpentine oil, and the varnish kept in full ebullition for about half an hour and left to cool. After the in soluble part is precipitated, which is completed in two or three days, the clear solution is drawn off and sub mitted to concentration in the manner above described. The solution is, however, previously mixed with three pounds of sulphur for every hundred weight of rubber employed. When the varnish has acquired the necessary thickness it is removed from the boiler. After the fabrics have been overlaid with this war nish, they are submitted to heat, which is gradually increased from 212° to 390 Fahrenheit during about one hour. Only that side of the cloth fabric which is covered with the rubber layer should be exposed to the leat. For the vulcanization in ordinary temperature, the caoutchoucite is reduced to a thick varnish, no sepa ration of its ingredients nor addition of sulphur being required. After the fabrics are overlaid with and dried, they are immersed successively in three reservoirs, which are connected with each other; the first being filled with a mixture of one part of chloride of sulphur with eighty or one hundred parts of sulphide of car

BowERs, of the city of Harrisburg, in the county of Dauphin, and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new and use ful improvement, consisting of a "Cellar-Hoistor El evator” and "Cellar Stairs or Steps”'combined. The construction of the same, and manner of com bination and arrangement, I will proceed to describe. The drawing represents a perspective view of the device in position for operation. The essential feature of novelty in-this invention consists in providing a compact, convenient, and pow elful hoisting macline, that will always be ready for use, and coubining the sane with cellar stairs or steps, substantially as follows: The uprights or side supports B B” of the stairs are made of timber sufficiently strong for the purpose. They are given a proper degree of inclination from a vertical position, and rest upon a proper foundation, their üpper ends being securely fastened to the sill D. The Said pieces B B have their front edges grooved or chanieled out, as seen at u u in the drawing. These grooves are intended to act as a guide-way for tle lloisting table A. Said table is made substantially as shown in the drawing. That portion of the frame-work of the table A that bears against the pieces B B has tongues formed upon it to enter into and slide easily in the grooves in said pieces when in position, thus retaining and guiding tlie table when it is loisted or lowered. Upon each side of the frame of table A, at a point, s, ropes or chains b b are rigidly securell by their ends. Said ropes or chains are carried up over the groeved wheels n. n. These wheels are secured to the outside surfaces of the pieces B B, and near their up per ends, in such a manuer as to permit them to turn íreely upon the studs or bolts that. secure them in place. The ropes or chains b b are made fast to the barrel shaft c of the winch or crane-gear. Said winch or huisting gear is constructed substantially as is shown in the drawing, and consists of a barrel shaft, c, and driving shaft d, that are supported by suitable hang (IS. Upon one end of the shaft c a large gear-wheel, o, is secured. A small pinión, r, that is fastened to the driving shaft d, meshes into the wheel o, as is shown. Upon the opposite end of the shaft d a crank, e, is secured. A ratchet-wheel, i, in which the click or pawl p catches, is also fastened in place upon the shaft d, im mediately in the rear of the crank e. i . - The supporting hangers are connected so that the entire winch is in a compact and portable form. It . is bolted or otherwise properly secured to the joists or other suitable timbers in-the cellar, overhead, so that the handle of the crank e is accessible from the floor. The position given the said winch should be directly opposite to or in a straight line in the rear of the cellar stairs, so that.-the ropes b b will train in a cor reet mannel. The stepsia a a, &c., should be set back a short distance from the front edge of the uprights B B, so as to permit the table A to pass their front edges readily. The uprights B B' should have their lower ends let into the bottom of the cellar up to the dotted line E F. The lower portion or frame-work of the table A should also bé sunk a similar depth, a proper excava tion being made to permit the same. This should be walled or planked upon its sides, so as to prevent dirt from falling in and obstructing the table. This plan of construction will bring the top of the: table A on a line with the bottom of the cellar. In fact, if it is floored, the table will form a portion of the floor. In using this device, weighty articles can be placed upon the table with great ease, either for elevating tlem from the cellar floor to the street, or for lower , ing them from the street into the cellar. By the operation of the winch C, the hoisting and lowering is rendered easy and secure, as the ratchet wheel acts as a guard to prevent slipping, and enables the operator to arrest the ascent ordescent of the ar ticle at any point desired. The frame-work of the hoisting table A may be provided with small wheels or rollers, with flanges, to run upon the front faces of the uprights B B. The grooves in the faces of the uprights can then be dis pensed with, as well as the tongues upon the frame. I do not desire to claim broadly the general appli cation of a winch to an elevator, as I am aware that it has been so applied; but What I do clain as new, of my invention, and de sire to secure by Letters Patent of the United States, 1S The peculiar combination and arrangement of the elevating table A, stair upriglits B B, and winch C, the whole constructed and operating substantially as herein set forth. .. HENRY L.
