Kishline, Kenosha, Wis., assignor to Nash-Kelvinator Corporation, Kenosha, Wis., a corporation of Maryland Application June 16, 1945, Serial No. 599,885 Claims. (C. 192-53) 1. This invention relates to improvementS. in transmission gearing and nore particularly to intermediate speed clutch devices used in auto mobile transmissions. It is an object of this invention to provide means whereby the shifting of gears in a transmission will be facilitated. It is another object of this invention to provide means reducing the amount of manual effort re quired to shift the gears in an automobile trans mission. it is a further object of this invention to pro vide means which will efficiently synchronize the Speeds of the transmission gears during shifting operations. Further objects and advantages of this inven tion will be apparent from a consideration of the following description and the attached drawings, of which there is one. Sheet, and in which: Figure is a side elevation, partially in Section, Figure represents a plan view of a friction of a power transmission of an automobile; cone driving disc; and Figure is a sectional view taken on a plane indicated by the line. 3-3 Of Figure and look ing in the direction of the arrows. In Figure is illustrated the conventional type of automotive transmission known to the art at the present time having a case it which is Secured to the bell clutch housing (not shown). Trans mission case is provided With a cover and the transmission within the case consists of a main shaft. journaled in a bearing which is Secured in the rear wall of case fo and a coun tershaft which is fast in the walls of case 0. Rotatively Supported upon the countershaft is the usual countershaft gear cluster generally indicated at 8, the gears of which are in con stant mesh with gear 28, which is rotatively sup ported upon the main shaft and With a gear 22 formed upon the clutch shaft 25 which extends from the bell ciutch housing into the transmission case 2. The clutch shaft 24 is journaled in a ball bearing 26 supported in the forward Wall of the transmission case and is provided with a hole 28 in its rearward end within which roller bearings are positioned for rotatively support ing the forward end 32 of the main shaft (i. Generally indicated at 34 is a jaw clutch by means of which the main shaft is selectively connected either directly to the clutch shaft 24 through its high speed clutch teeth 36 for a direct drive connection or to the gear 20 through its intermediate speed gear teeth 38 for a second speed drive through the countershaft gear 0. 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 2. cluster 8. Gear teeth 36 are cut around the outer Surface of flange 40 on the rearward end of clutch Shaft. 24. Intermediate speed clutch gear teeth 38 are formed on the. Outer surface of intermedi ate gear 20 adjacent the jaw clutch 34. It will be noted that, the gear 2) is rotatively Supported on the main shaft by a sleeve A2 of bearing material and is held against axial movement forwardly along the shaft by means of a Snap. ring 44 which is fitted within a groove cut in the main shaft f4. The other side of gear 26, abuts the forward end of the enlarged splined portion 46 of main shaft 4. The jaw clutch mechanism 34 has an outer Collar 48, the inner surface of which is defined by gear teeth 50.", "year": 1950}
