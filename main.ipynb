PORTER DICKINSON, OF AMEIERST, MASSACHUSETTS. IMPROVEMENT IN CORN - SHELLERS. Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 10,003, dated September 6, 1853. To aid what, it may concern, Amherst, in the county of Hampshire and State of Massachusetts, have invented a new and useful Improvement in Corn-Shellers; and I hereby declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, ref erence being had to the annexed drawings, making part of this specification. My invention is applicable to corn-shellers similar to that patented by J. W. Gordon, October 7, 1846, and is designed to remedy the defects existing in that class of corn-shell ers as heretofore constructed, in which it was necessary to force through each cobby hand, the screw-thread upon the revolving shellers not being sufficient for the purpose; and my improvement consists in the addition to ma chines of this description of a pair of toothed rollers, which seize the cob after the corn is shelled from it and drag it entirely through the machine. In order to enable others to make and use my invention, I will proceed to describe its construction and operation. Figurei is an elevation of the machine; Fig. 2, a plan; Fig. 3, a transverse section through the operating parts. Fig. 4 is a view of one of the toothed shellers detached. Fig. 5 is a front view of the hollow tube D with the toothed shellers in place. place by the straps.f, under which they pass. Be it known that I, PORTER DICKINSON, of A slight motion out and in is thus allowed to the guides, by which means the conical open ing adapts itself to the size of the ear of corn to be shelled, the projections g holding the ear and preventing it from being turned. Im mediately in the rear of this guide, and adapt ed to the face of the revolving tube D, are two toothed shellers, h. h\", which, when the machine is not in use, approach very near to each other, as represented in Fig. 1, but are forced apart by the cob when in operation, as seen in Fig. 5, and are pressed together by the action of the springs i i\", which permit them to recede from each other an amount proportionate to the size of the cob. k k are two toothed rollers, placed imme diately behind the revolving tube D. The lower one of these rollers is Secured to the shaft l, having a gear, m, at one end, which engages with a gear, n, upon the shaft of the driving-wheel B, by which means the lower roller is made to revolve. The upper roller is pressed down to its work by springs E, which permit it to rise and fall, according to the size of the colb to be drawn through. Operation: Motion being given to the crank by the right hand, the ear is pressed into the conical opening between the guides d, which are permitted to recede from each other by the yielding of the springs e. The cob is then A is the frame-work of the machine. made to enter between the revolving toothed B is a cogged wheel driven by the crank C, shellers hit, the teeth of which tear the grain by which motion is communicated to the op from the cob.
